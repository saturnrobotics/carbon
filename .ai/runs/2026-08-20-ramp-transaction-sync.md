# Feature run: Ramp transaction sync integration

- Date: 2026-08-20
- Mode: approval-per-phase
- Request: "we need add a /feature for a Ramp integration that allows transactions from ramp to flow back to carbon. there is quite a big syncing problem here. i believe ramp has purchase orders, purchase invoices and payments. they also have payments without anything." + "here are the api documentation: https://docs.ramp.com/developer-api/v1/introduction we have sandbox access that we can use for testing. please start by getting a good understanding of ramp and carbon"
- Phase plan: research [run — ERP-domain (AP/payments/accounting sync), user explicitly requested understanding phase] · spec [run — crosses modules, new data model, hard matching problem] · plan [run] · execute [run] · test [run — integration settings + matching UI are user-facing; confirm at phase time] · self-review [run — default]

## Decisions
<!-- approval mode: gates are human; decisions recorded as the user makes them -->
- 2026-08-20 (user, post-research): (1) Card transactions → NetSuite approach: new lightweight card-transaction document with its own posting (Dr expense / Cr card liability). (2) Statement payments → my best-practice call (delegated). (3) Reimbursements IN v1 (mechanism delegated to spec). (4) Coding dimensions pushed to Ramp: all EXCEPT items, customers, suppliers — those can be added later. (5) Direction: BOTH — push Carbon POs/invoices into Ramp AND pull Ramp bills/payments/transactions into Carbon. (6) Auth: OAuth is the destination; if sandbox blocks it, develop on API-style client credentials first, migrate to OAuth later (Ramp client_credentials uses the same client id/secret, so the credential schema supports both from day one).

## Phase log
- research: DONE 2026-08-20 — .ai/research/ramp-transaction-sync.md. Five parallel agents (Ramp API v1, Ramp first-party ERP integrations, industry consensus, Carbon integration architecture, Carbon AP/payments model). Key conclusions: Carbon acts as Ramp's "accounting provider" (push CoA/vendors → pull SYNC_READY → post → confirm via POST /accounting/syncs); card = liability account, never merchant AP; one accounting home per transaction; statement payments = liability transfers via Ramp "transfers" endpoint; only CLEARED+SYNC_READY posts; Carbon has NO card/expense document type today (biggest open design question). 7 open questions carried to spec (see findings file).
- spec: DONE 2026-08-20 — .ai/specs/2026-08-20-ramp-transaction-sync.md (status draft). All open questions resolved: six by user, five sub-decisions delegated + documented for veto (statement payments as cardTransaction type Payment; reimbursements as employee-as-supplier invoices; explicit Send-to-Ramp action; cashbacks in scope; no Carbon-side sync ledger v1; invoicing module home; optional entity filter). Prior-art note: bank-reconciliation spec (in-progress, tables NOT built) — composed with, not duplicated.
- 2026-08-20 (user, veto round): repayments IN scope v1 → spec updated (cardTransaction type Repayment, repaid_at cursor, expense-line reversal; confirm mechanism = sandbox-verify). Bank-rec sequencing assessed: build Ramp first (orthogonal; compose at journal-line level).
- 2026-08-20 (user, veto round 2): invoice→Ramp push = AUTOMATIC as submitted DRAFT bills — Ramp's own approval workflow decides approval (user's insight; POST /bills auto-approved path never used). Spec updated: pushInvoices toggle, archive-on-Carbon-settlement, double-payment-race risk, draft-API verify items. Spec now final pending plan-phase go.
- plan: DONE 2026-08-20 — .ai/plans/2026-08-20-ramp-transaction-sync.md (14 tasks). Precedent research via 3 Explore agents (ee integration shapes, jobs/webhook wiring, invoicing/DB). Spec amended (changelog): sweep-cursor outbound transport (SYNC handler is ProviderID-locked), payment-sibling single-column xid() PK, dynamicOptions account pickers, v1 dimensions = cost centers. Task 1 = sandbox endpoint verification (BLOCKED on user creds at execute time).
- NEXT (awaiting approval): execute — 🛑 plan approval gate. Task 1 needs sandbox clientId/clientSecret from Brad.

## Execute log
- 2026-08-20 — executed via /execute. Tasks done in dependency order, each subagent-built then main-agent gated (scoped typecheck + package tests + biome + translations) and committed one-per-task.
- Tasks 3, 4, 5 built first (stack-independent @carbon/ee). Then user booted the `brisbane` crbn stack → Task 2 migration applied (`crbn migrate` via `packages/dev/bin/crbn`, types regenerated). Then 6, 11 (parallel), 7+12 (parallel), 8→9→10 (sequential on ramp-sync.ts), 13.
- Commits: 3 `431bc7b2c` · 4 `640b723aa` · 5 `cf748ff54` · docs `3addb2ad8` · 2 `427f73ebc` · **enum fixup `70090e0bc`** · 11 `1d53aaae8` · 6 `33918de68` · 7 `46237c45f` · 12 (UI+translations) · 8 `141c9d60c` · 9 `bffe690da` · 10 `aab50524b` · 13 `acfb42a8c1`.

### Deviations / gap-fills (flagged)
- **Enum fixup (`70090e0bc`)**: Task 2's `'Card Transaction'` journal enum value broke two exhaustive consumers (`POSTING_POLICY` in accounting-core; the `journalEntrySourceTypes` UI mirror). Fixed as internal-journal policy + credit-card icon. Task 2's verify block should have included an erp/ee typecheck.
- **Task 8**: PO-line-amount reconciliation deferred — the Ramp `purchase_order_line_item_id` field is Task-1-gated and absent from the models; PO-derived amounts kept, header updated. `TODO(task-1)`.
- **`// TODO(task-1)` markers** across families for unverified Ramp field names / sync_status / enum values (transaction amount minor-units, COST_CENTER selection type, bill/payment status strings, funding_method, remote_id-accepted-on-create, draft-bill body shape, submit-returns-id).
- **GAP — webhook receiving route not built**: no `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/webhook.ramp.$companyId.ts`. `ensureRampWebhook` registers a webhook + `verifyRampWebhookSignature`/`completeWebhookVerification` exist, but no route receives POSTs. Inbound freshness = hourly `ramp-sweep` only. Flagged to user for decision (build vs sweep-only).
- Stale `// TODO(task-7)` comment remains in `packages/ee/src/ramp/hooks.server.ts` (ramp-sync IS registered now) — minor cleanup pending.

## Feature-complete pass (2026-08-22)
- **Webhook route built** (`5f3bf72df6`): `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/webhook.ramp.$companyId.ts` — closes the plan gap (route now receives Ramp POSTs, verifies signature, answers the challenge, triggers ramp-sync). Sweep remains the correctness path. Stale `TODO(task-7)` in hooks.server.ts removed; rule updated.
- **/self-review** run (4 parallel reviewers over the ~9.7k-line diff). Findings fixed:
  - `fa02fefd0c` — **cardTransactionLine RLS shadowing** (Must-fix): unqualified `"cardTransactionId"` in the Draft-parent EXISTS bound to `cardTransaction`'s own same-named column → always-false → all RLS'd line writes denied. Fix-forward migration `20260822154812`. + FX!=1 and split-rounding journal tests, assertBalanced comment corrected.
  - `16d36618e8` — **ramp-sync tenancy + financial correctness**: companyId scoping on 11 service-role writes; stuck-Draft false-confirm (`.neq status Draft` on the dup guard); `cardTransaction.exchangeRate` set from stored currency rate (was defaulting to 1 → foreign face value in base GL); PO-convert dedupe on retry; N+1 reconfirm batched.
- Residual (documented, not blocking): webhook challenge one-call amplification + no replay check (idempotent/`concurrency:1` mitigated); post→link atomicity window (mapping-idempotent, narrow); cursor lost-update (bounded); outbound create-response parse + bill/PO line-amount units are `TODO(task-1)` sandbox-gated; ramp-sync is 2730 lines (extraction is a follow-up).

## Resume pass (2026-08-27)
- Found 5 uncommitted files in the tree. Triaged: generated-types FK-order churn REVERTED per lessons.md (turbo ride-along); committed `1ab07b71aa` posting-policy golden-list fix ('Card Transaction' in POSTING_SYNC_DEFAULT_SOURCE_TYPES — the full ee suite was failing on the branch), `ece3cf6e78` Rillet webhook vault fix (token scrubbed from metadata since 20260817122916 → route 401'd every delivery; now resolves secrets first), `d19f048d72` official Ramp wordmark logo. LEFT UNCOMMITTED: `apps/erp/app/components/SettingsSectionHeader.tsx` styling change (references financial-reporting page; provenance unclear, not obviously Ramp work — flagged to Brad).
- Gates: erp+ee typecheck green; full ee suite 576/576; repo-wide `pnpm test` 24/24 tasks green (execute Step-5 finishing gate, previously unrun).

## Outcome
- **Feature code-complete** on `ramp-transaction-sync-integration` (~19 commits). All gates green: scoped typechecks (ee/jobs/erp), deno builder tests (8), ee ramp vitest (20), 0 missing translations (13 locales), self-review Must-fixes + high-value Risks fixed.
- BLOCKED on user for the two verification tasks only: Task 1 (live sandbox endpoint probe — resolves the `TODO(task-1)` field-name assumptions) + Task 14 (browser verification) need Ramp sandbox `clientId`/`clientSecret` (and a stable local stack; brisbane Postgres was flapping during this pass).
- Ready for PR (draft until sandbox verification lands).
