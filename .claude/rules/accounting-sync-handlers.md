# Accounting Sync Handlers

Syncs Carbon entities <-> external accounting providers. **Three live providers**: Xero (`ProviderID.XERO`), QuickBooks Online (`ProviderID.QBO`), and Rillet (`ProviderID.RILLET`). (QuickBooks *Desktop* shipped then was removed 2026-08-01; Sage was never built.) `SyncFactory` is a **provider-keyed registry** (`registries[providerId][entityType]`) — each provider's `index.ts` barrel calls `SyncFactory.register(...)`. Runs on **Inngest** (the old trigger.dev `from-/to-accounting-sync` task design is gone — do not look for `UPSERT_MAP`/`DELETE_MAP` or a `trigger/` dir; neither exists).

Design specs: `.ai/specs/2026-08-12-accounting-sync-reconciler-unification.md` (v5 — ONE state-shaped decision core; events are hints; the authoritative design of record) and `.ai/specs/implemented/2026-08-05-accounting-document-representation.md` (AR/AP documents replay their posting journal; provider items non-tracked). The superseded v2/v3/v4 specs (engine + ledger + pull sweep + Phase F/G payment sync-back; journal policy/dimensions/tie-out; delivery robustness — converged subscriptions, truthful ledger, outbound sweep, tie-out enforcement) were removed 2026-08-13 — their shipped behavior is documented in THIS rule; their history is in git. **Always-on (implemented 2026-08-13, plan `.ai/plans/2026-08-13-accounting-sync-automated-postings-only.md` Tasks 1–6+8):** posting sync mirrors Carbon's automated GL postings whenever an accounting integration is connected — no master `postingSync.enabled` toggle, no per-source-type on/off, no `journalEntry` entity gate (defaulted on in `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG` and forced on in every `build*SyncConfig`). `Manual` and `Opening Balance` journals NEVER sync (`POSTING_POLICY[...].syncable: false` → the `MANUAL_DISABLED` exclude at `posting.ts`; the external ledger owns manual journals and its own opening balances). Note the exclude `reason`/`message` are still worded "Manual" for both — the gate is `syncable === false`, not a name check. Legacy `enabled` fields stay in the stored schema for parse-compat but are never read; per-type granularity (individual vs daily-summary) remains the only per-type setting. Plan Tasks 7 (reversal/void propagation audit) and 9 (lock AR/AP families to documents) remain open.

## Architecture: class-per-entity syncers, not a handler map

The sync engine lives in `packages/ee/src/accounting/` (package `@carbon/ee/accounting`):
- `core/sync.ts` — `SyncFactory.getSyncer(context)` returns the right syncer by `providerId` + `entityType` from the registry.
- `core/types.ts` — `BaseEntitySyncer<TLocal, TRemote, TOmit>` abstract base (~800 lines). Implements `pushToAccounting` / `pullFromAccounting` (+ `*Batch*`) with: mapping lookup, `shouldSync` gate, fast-bailout on unchanged timestamps, `mapToRemote`/`mapToLocal`, then `withTriggersDisabled` DB write + `linkEntities`. Also `SupportsIncrementalPull` (`listChanges({since}) → ProviderChange[]`) — the pull-sweep contract (QBO CDC, Rillet `updated.gt`, Xero `/Payments` `If-Modified-Since`).
- `providers/{xero,quickbooks-online,rillet}/entities/*.ts` — concrete syncers. Xero `ContactSyncer` backs both `customer` AND `vendor`; QBO/Rillet have separate Customer + Vendor syncers. Each provider has item/bill/invoice(+PO/journalEntry) syncers and a **`PaymentSyncer`** (see Payment sync-back below). `employee` is not implemented.
- `core/external-mapping.ts` — `ExternalIntegrationMappingService` / `createMappingService(db, companyId)`: all ID linking goes through the `externalIntegrationMapping` table.
- `core/models.ts` — Zod schemas, `ProviderID`, `AccountingSyncSchema`, `ENTITY_DEFINITIONS`, `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG`, `PostingSyncSettings` (`families.ar`/`families.ap` = `documents|journals|none`).
- `core/service.ts` — `getAccountingIntegration()` (reads `companyIntegration` row) + `getProviderIntegration()` (instantiates the right provider; applies the merged per-company `syncConfig`).

## Entity types & directions

`AccountingEntityType` = `customer | vendor | item | employee | purchaseOrder | bill | salesOrder | invoice | payment | inventoryAdjustment | journalEntry | charge`. `charge` is a Carbon `cardTransaction` pushed as the provider's native card-charge object (see "Card charges as provider objects"). `payment` is `dependsOn: ['invoice','bill']` and **two-way** (Phase G): provider-recorded payments pull back (Phase F) and Carbon-born Posted payments push out as provider payment documents. Routing is per-record by origin (the `payment` mapping), not a static direction — see Payment sync-back.

`SyncDirection` = `"two-way" | "push-to-accounting" | "pull-from-accounting"` (NOT the old `from-/to-/bi-directional`). Each entity has an `EntityConfig { enabled, direction, owner: "carbon" | "accounting", syncFromDate? }`. Per-entity defaults live in `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG`, deep-merged with the company's stored `syncConfig`; providers then force an entity's config in their `build{Xero,Qbo,Rillet}SyncConfig`. **Carbon owns everything** is the standardized stance: every provider forces the master + document entities `customer`/`vendor`/`item`/`invoice`/`bill` to `push-to-accounting` / `owner: "carbon"` (`XERO_CARBON_OWNED_ENTITIES`, `QBO_CARBON_OWNED_ENTITIES`, Rillet's `RILLET_PUSH_ONLY_ENTITIES`) — the provider is a downstream mirror. `payment` is the one accounting-owned exception (forced `pull-from-accounting` / `owner: "accounting"`; Rillet two-way for Phase G push-back). There is **no** per-entity "Source of Truth" setting — it was removed; `owner` is provider-forced, not user-configurable. Rillet's `customer`/`vendor` are the one place a Carbon-owned entity has a working PULL path: the explicit contact import below enqueues `pull-from-accounting` operations by hand (see the Rillet contact import section) — the automatic direction is unchanged, and `owner: "carbon"` is exactly what keeps a re-import from overwriting a linked record. `owner` decides the winner on conflict: for a Carbon-owned entity, an inbound provider change to an already-linked record is skipped (`BaseEntitySyncer.pullBatchFromAccounting`, `core/types.ts`). Note the webhook path sends an explicit `pull-from-accounting` that overrides `direction`, so a net-new record created directly in the provider can still be ingested — `owner: "carbon"` only guards *linked* records; QBO's CDC pull-sweep (`listChanges`) does honor `direction` and skips push-only entities entirely.

## Inngest functions (entry points)

These live in `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/integrations/` (+ `events/sync.ts`), exported via that dir's `index.ts`, and registered in `packages/jobs/src/inngest/index.ts`. Event-name <-> trigger-key map: `packages/lib/src/trigger.ts` & `packages/lib/src/events.ts`. Fire with `trigger("<key>", payload)`.

| Inngest id | event | file | trigger key / fired from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sync-external-accounting` | `carbon/sync-external-accounting` | `sync-external-accounting.ts` | `sync-external-accounting`; fired by the inbound webhooks — `webhook.xero.ts`, `webhook.rillet.$companyId.ts`, `webhook.quickbooks.$companyId.ts` |
| `accounting-pull-sweep` | — | `accounting-pull-sweep.ts` | cron `*/30 * * * *`; iterates every active integration that implements `SupportsIncrementalPull` (`listChanges`) — the **INBOUND correctness guarantee** behind the webhooks (webhooks are latency, not correctness) |
| `accounting-outbound-sweep` | — | `accounting-outbound-sweep.ts` | cron `15,45 * * * *` (offset from the pull sweep) — the **OUTBOUND correctness guarantee** (v4 Pillar B); see the sweep section below |
| `accounting-backfill` | `carbon/accounting-backfill` | `accounting-backfill.ts` | `accounting-backfill` |
| `rillet-import-contacts` | `carbon/rillet-import-contacts` | `rillet-import-contacts.ts` | the Rillet integration's **Import customers & vendors** action; the only on-demand PULL of master data — see the Rillet contact import section below |
| `accounting-consolidation` | — | `accounting-consolidation.ts` | cron `0 2 * * *`; pushes one aggregated provider journal per posting date for daily-consolidation configs (drains hold those journal ops for it) |
| `accounting-reconciliation` | — | `accounting-reconciliation.ts` | cron `0 3 * * 1` (Mondays 03:00 UTC) — presence drift check + `accountingSyncTieOut` writer; see the tie-out section below |
| `event-handler-sync` | `carbon/event-sync` | `events/sync.ts` | the SYNC event-system handler (see event-system.md) — DB writes -> push to the provider |

### Per-tenant isolation and dead OAuth grants

The four crons (`pull-sweep`, `outbound-sweep`, `reconciliation`, `consolidation`) walk every active integration with one `step.run` per company, through `runIsolatedCompanyStep` (`accounting-auth-failure.ts`). Two invariants: a tenant that exhausts its step retries returns `{ error }` and the loop continues — it never fails the run for every tenant after it (it used to: one company with a dead token skipped every later company on every sweep); and an `AccountingAuthError` (the provider's token endpoint answered 400/401 — `invalid_grant` "Refresh token not found", revoked, rotated-and-lost) is NOT retried, because nothing retries a dead grant back to life. It returns `{ authFailed }`, `recordIntegrationAuthFailure` increments a redis counter (`integrations:<companyId>:<providerId>:auth-failures`, cleared by any successful pass), notifies the configurer (`integration.updatedBy`, `NotificationEvent.IntegrationSync`, deduped to one per day), and at `AUTH_FAILURE_DISABLE_THRESHOLD` (12 consecutive ≈ 3 h across both sweeps — `drainSyncOperations` rethrows `AccountingAuthError` like `RatelimitError` instead of parking it as Failed rows, so drain-path auth failures count too) sets `companyIntegration.active = false`, clears the integration cache keys, and notifies "disabled — reconnect". The OAuth callback routes upsert `active: true`, so reconnecting is the whole recovery. Note a deactivated accounting integration makes the period-close "External GL sync complete" blocker auto-pass (it only checks ACTIVE integrations) — that is the trade-off the user chose over an integration that sits active and silently syncs nothing.

Why tokens die: Xero and QBO rotate refresh tokens, and Carbon refreshes reactively on a 401 (`providers/*/provider.ts`). Several runners (both sweeps, webhooks, event sync, reconciliation) build their own provider from the vault and can refresh with the same token. `createOAuthClient.refresh()` therefore calls `beforeRefresh` first (`core/service.ts` re-reads the vault): a stored refresh token that differs from the in-memory one means another runner already rotated — adopt it, skip the token endpoint. And `onTokenRefresh` now THROWS when `persistIntegrationSecrets` fails: the provider has already rotated, so a lost write is a dead credential; failing the run right there beats "Refresh token not found" thirty minutes later with no trail. Pinned by `core/oauth-refresh.test.ts`.

### The operation ledger — enqueue, cooldown, truthful close

Every entry point routes through the durable **`accountingSyncOperation`** ledger (`accounting-sync-operations.ts` in jobs + `core/operations.ts` in ee) between enqueue and `SyncFactory.getSyncer(...).pushBatch/pullBatch`. The table is **no longer accounting-exclusive**: the Ramp (spend-management) sync writes terminal `Warning` rows here for its own failed/skipped items and deletes them on the next successful sync via `clearResolvedSyncOperations` (ee `core/operations.ts`) — see `ramp-integration.md` → "Sync Activity". Ramp does NOT use the enqueue/drain machinery below; it records dispositions directly.

- **Enqueue.** `enqueueSyncOperations` absorbs re-triggers into the live (Pending/In Flight) row. The v5 reconcile path enqueues with trigger `"reconcile"`, which is **never cooldown-gated** — a state-derived decision is idempotent, so an unchanged entity decides `nothing` instead of needing a window, and a changed one enqueues immediately. The 60s completed-row cooldown (`SYNC_OPERATION_COOLDOWN_MS`, `isCooldownTrigger`: `event`/`webhook`) survives ONLY on the inbound/webhook entry points (`sync-external-accounting`, the pull sweep), which don't route through the reconciler. `isStatusTransitionEvent` and `getPaymentPushDecision` were deleted with v5 (nothing to bypass; payment state lives in the decision core).
- **Drain.** `drainSyncOperations` claims Pending (+ stale In Flight) rows in groups of (entityType, direction); an op claimed more than `MAX_SYNC_OPERATION_ATTEMPTS` (10) times parks as `Failed` `ATTEMPTS_EXHAUSTED` instead of running again (a human Retry resets the loop deliberately).
- **Truthful close (v4 Pillar C).** `getSyncOperationCloseDecision` decides how a claimed op closes: syncer `skipped` WITH a `remoteId` (fast-bailout, already linked) → `Completed` stamping that externalId; `skipped` WITHOUT one (shouldSync gate, disabled entity, parked payment) → `Skipped` via `skipOperation` (reason in `errorMessage`, `errorCode` null so the UI renders it neutrally); push `success` WITHOUT a `remoteId` → `Failed` `POSTCONDITION` (a push success must produce an external id/mapping — recording it green is the phantom-success bug). A no-op is never recorded `Completed`. `Skipped → Pending` is an allowed transition (`SYNC_OPERATION_ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`, `core/models.ts` — Retry covers the drain's machine no-op closes too). Batch AND single pushes preserve structured `JournalEntrySyncError` failures via `toSyncResultError` (`core/types.ts`), so e.g. `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` lands as a Warning with metadata instead of a flattened Failed string.

`sync-external-accounting.ts` flow: parse `AccountingSyncSchema` → `getAccountingIntegration` → `getProviderIntegration` → enqueue one ledger op per entity + direction (trigger: `webhook` syncs keep `"webhook"`, scheduled/trigger syncs enqueue as `"event"`; both respect the completed-row cooldown) → drain. Returns `{ success, enqueue, drain }` summaries.

`events/sync.ts` (v5) treats events as **hints, not decisions**: it maps DB table → entity type via `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` in **`events/sync-tables.ts`** (import-light on purpose — no Inngest/env boot — so the subscriptions invariant test can import it): `customer→customer`, `supplier→vendor`, `item→item`, `purchaseOrder→purchaseOrder`, `purchaseInvoice→bill`, `salesInvoice→invoice`, `salesOrder→salesOrder`, `journal→journalEntry`, `payment→payment`; dedupes the batch into `(entityType, entityId)` refs (DELETEs logged/skipped — a deleted row also reconciles to nothing), and calls the same `reconcileEntities` executor the outbound sweep uses, then drains. There are no per-table decision branches here anymore — what happens is decided by `computeReconcileDecision` from CURRENT state, never from the event's old/new delta. Wrapped in `step.run` per company+provider for checkpointing.

## Event subscriptions — code-derived, converged (v4 Pillar A)

`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/subscriptions.ts` (exported from the `./accounting` barrel) is the single source of truth for the SYNC event-system subscriptions each provider's outbound sync needs: `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS[providerId]` + the idempotent `ensureProviderSubscriptions(client, companyId, providerId)` (the create RPC upserts on `(companyId, name, table)`; rows for tables no longer required are deleted). Subscription name: `${providerId}-sync` (`getSyncSubscriptionName`).

- **Converged from three call sites** — the install hook, the `onUpdate` hook (every settings save of an installed integration), and the outbound sweep — so existing installs self-heal at runtime. **No migration ever backfills subscription rows**; migrations only attach table triggers (`20260807152238_payment-event-trigger.sql` is the precedent).
- **The set**: every provider gets `customer`/`supplier`/`item`/`salesInvoice`/`purchaseInvoice` (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) + `journal` (INSERT/UPDATE only — journals are immutable once posted and DELETE sync doesn't exist). all three providers add `payment` (INSERT/UPDATE — Phase G outbound push, now Rillet/Xero/QBO); Xero adds `purchaseOrder` + `salesOrder`; QBO adds `purchaseOrder` only. **`address` is deliberately absent everywhere** — address edits reach sync via the parent-row `updatedAt` bump interceptor; a direct address subscription is a dead letter.
- Provider hooks (`packages/ee/src/{rillet,xero,quickbooks}/hooks.server.ts`) are thin wrappers over the convergence. The QBO install hook is **no longer a no-op** (its syncers shipped), and `quickbooksOnUninstall` exists. `onUpdate` is a new `IntegrationServerHooks` member (`packages/ee/src/types.ts`; registry `packages/ee/src/hooks.server.ts`; wired in `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/settings+/integrations.$id.tsx`).
- **Invariant test**: `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/events/subscriptions-mapping.test.ts` pins every subscribed table ↔ a `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` entry (`events/sync-tables.ts`) ↔ a registered syncer for that provider — a subscription that routes nowhere fails CI. (`salesOrder` got its map entry as part of this; it was a dead Xero subscription before.)

## Outbound reconciliation sweep (v4 Pillar B)

Doctrine, mirroring the inbound pull sweep: **events are latency; the sweep is outbound correctness.** Any lost event (missing subscription, queue loss, cooldown swallow, phantom Completed) becomes ≤30-min staleness, never permanent loss. `accounting-outbound-sweep.ts` (cron `15,45 * * * *`), per company with an active accounting integration:

1. **Subscription convergence** — `ensureProviderSubscriptions` (the self-healing invariant check; runs first so a repaired install's next events flow normally).
2. **Candidate refs (scope, not decisions)** — pages posted journals (Posted/Reversed, `reversalOfId` null), posted documents (`SWEPT_BILL_STATUSES`/`SWEPT_INVOICE_STATUSES` — the posted set minus the transient mid-posting `Pending`), posted payments (Rillet only), and parked `Warning UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` bills regardless of window. Window floor: `getSweepFloorDate` = today − `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (7), raised to the entity's `syncFromDate` — deliberately short; history beyond it is the explicit backfill's job.
3. **Reconcile** — every ref goes to `reconcileEntities` (the SAME executor the event path calls); the decisions (missing-remotely enqueue incl. the phantom Completed-without-mapping repair, policy exclusions, the capped `MAX_REDRIVE_ATTEMPTS` re-drive when a bill's posted "Purchase Invoice" journal now exists) all live in `computeReconcileDecision`.
4. **Drain** — including what this run enqueued/re-drove. This is **Xero's only periodic drain** (it has no incremental pull), so UI retries stop rotting as Pending.
5. **Alert (Pillar F)** — failed ops left after the drain fire one in-app `NotificationEvent.IntegrationSync` to the integration's configurer (`integration.updatedBy`), linking to the integration's settings page. A notification failure never fails the sweep.

## The v5 reconciler (one brain)

- **`integrations/reconcile.ts`** — `computeReconcileDecision(input)`: the pure, state-shaped decision for every outbound entity (journals via the shared `planJournalPostingFromState` policy core; documents incl. the re-drive and the changed-since-failure retry; payments; master data via `updatedAt` vs `mapping.lastSyncedAt`). Import-light; exhaustively pinned by **`reconcile-golden.test.ts`** (spec Step A), whose FIX-1..4 entries document every deliberate difference from the legacy paths.
- **`integrations/reconcile-executor.ts`** — `reconcileEntities({refs, …})`: batch-first state loading (one query per concern per entity type — snapshots, ledger rows incl. `:reversal` twins, mappings, the parked-bill backing-journal join), then the pure decision per entity, then application through the existing ledger primitives with trigger `"reconcile"` (migration `20260812093418` widened the CHECK).
- Callers: `events/sync.ts` (hints) and the outbound sweep (window walk). The journal policy core is shared with `planJournalPostingOperation` (still used by the manual backfill), so policy routing cannot diverge between callers.

## Reconciliation + tie-out (v3 §5 / v4 Pillar E)

`accounting-reconciliation.ts` (cron `0 3 * * 1`) is **provider-agnostic** — all three providers, no longer Xero-only:

- **Presence** — pages the last 90 days of Completed journalEntry ops and verifies each distinct externalId still exists remotely via `fetchRemoteJournalTotals` (`core/remote-journal.ts` — dispatches on the concrete provider class: Xero manual journals, Rillet journal entries, QBO journal entries; returns net debit-signed totals per remote account ref, `found: false` for missing/voided/deleted, never throws except `RatelimitError`). Drift entries land at `companyIntegration.metadata.settings.postingSync.lastReconciliation` (the SyncActivity banner's feed).
- **Tie-out** — writes one `accountingSyncTieOut` row per (integration × accountingPeriod × account) (migration `20260811223145`; single-column FK to `accountingPeriod` — its PK is `(id)` alone; RLS is SELECT-only under `accounting_view`, rows written by the cron via service role). Per cell: `carbonPostedAmount` split into `synced/docBacked/excluded/pending/blocked` by each journal's ledger disposition (least-delivered bucket wins across an op + its `:reversal` twin; `DOC_BACKED` counts as delivered only while the backing document really synced), `providerAmount` from the presence fetches (strictly reused, never fetched twice; NULL when uncovered), `internalDelta` (I1: carbonPosted − sum of buckets) and `externalDelta` (I5: synced − provider).
- **ERP surface** — `x+/accounting+/sync-tieout.tsx` (+ `$cellId` drawer drill-down), nav item under Accounting → Reports (`path.to.accountingSyncTieOut`); the SyncActivity tab gets a tie-out summary card + a Failed/Warning count badge. **Period close**: the "External GL sync complete" Blocker auto-check (`autoCheckKey: "external-gl-sync"`, seeded for new companies and reconciled for existing ones in the same migration) is computed by `getPeriodExternalGlSyncReadiness` (apps/erp `accounting.service.ts`) — every journal posted into the period must carry a terminal disposition (Completed/Excluded/Skipped) for every active accounting integration; auto-passes only when NO active accounting integration exists (posting sync is always-on when one is connected).

## externalIntegrationMapping table

Source of external-ID truth (the old per-entity `externalId` JSONB columns were dropped). Migrations: `20260128140000_external-integration-mapping.sql` (CREATE), `20260130005853_external-id-migration.sql` (made `externalId` nullable + added back-compat views), `20260204001831_external-integration-mapping-rls.sql` (RLS).

Columns: `id` (PK, `id()`), `entityType`, `entityId` (Carbon internal ID), `integration` (e.g. `'xero'`, `'linear'`), `externalId` (nullable), `allowDuplicateExternalId BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`, `metadata JSONB`, `lastSyncedAt`, `remoteUpdatedAt`, `createdAt/updatedAt/createdBy`, `companyId`.

Constraints:
- `UNIQUE (entityType, entityId, integration, companyId)` — one mapping per integration per entity (the `link`/`linkBatch` upsert conflict target).
- Partial `UNIQUE (integration, externalId, entityType, companyId) WHERE allowDuplicateExternalId = false` — enforces external-ID uniqueness unless many-to-one is opted in.

Back-compat views reconstruct the legacy `externalId` JSONB via `jsonb_object_agg`: `suppliers`, `customers`, `parts`, `materials`, `tools`, `consumables`, `services`, `salesOrders` — so view-reading app code keeps working.

## Payment sync-back (inbound AR/AP) — the family-agnostic core

Provider payments (a customer invoice paid, or a **vendor bill paid**) flow back
into Carbon as `payment` + `invoiceSettlement` rows that close the
`salesInvoice`/`purchaseInvoice`. All three providers share one core:

- `core/payment-application.ts` — `NormalizedPayment` (`family: 'ar'|'ap'`,
  `documentRemoteId`, `paymentRemoteId`, amount/currency/date/reference, `status`,
  optional `linkedDocuments` for multi-doc fan-out) + `upsertLocalPaymentDraft`,
  which writes a **Draft** `payment` (AR→`Receipt`/`customerId`; AP→`Disbursement`/
  `supplierId`) + one `invoiceSettlement` per mapped document
  (`targetSalesInvoiceId`/`targetPurchaseInvoiceId`), idempotent by the `payment`
  mapping, dropping unmapped documents. Returns a `postAction` (`post`/`void`/`none`).
- `core/payment-syncer.ts` — `PaymentSyncerBase` (pull, plus the Phase G push below). Providers implement
  `mapToNormalized(remote, entityId)` + `fetchRemote`. The base overrides
  `pullFromAccounting`/`pullBatchFromAccounting`: Draft write in the base tx, then
  **after commit** invokes the native `post-payment` edge fn (`{type:'post'|'void'}`
  via a lazily-imported `getCarbonServiceRole()`), which builds the GL journal,
  sets `payment.journalId`, and derives document status. **Pulled payments DO post
  to Carbon's GL** — no double-count because `documents`-mode `Payment` journals are
  DOC_BACKED-excluded from outbound push (the payment journal never re-posts to the
  provider). `getSettledInvoiceStatus` is retained for tests only (status is
  view-derived). Provider-omitted rates remain `null` until authoritative company
  and currency reads confirm identity; foreign payments require a valid snapshot.
  Inbound payment amounts/source principal stay in document currency, while
  target principal is base. Outbound prior-credit-funded payments are rejected
  before provider writes because the existing provider cash endpoints cannot
  represent those allocations.
- Provider syncers: `providers/{rillet,quickbooks-online,xero}/entities/payment.ts`.
  Composite entity-id convention: AR = `<documentRemoteId>:<paymentRemoteId>` (no
  prefix, back-compat), AP = `bill:<billRemoteId>:<paymentRemoteId>`.
  Detection: Rillet AR = `/invoice-payments?updated.gt` (poll). Rillet AP has NO
  org-wide feed — `GET /bill-payments` does not exist (verified 404 on sandbox
  2026-08-13; the unguarded call used to kill every pull sweep), so
  `listBillPaymentsUpdatedSince` is composed: `GET /bills?updated.gt` (paying a
  bill bumps its `updated_at`) then `GET /bills/{id}/payments` per changed bill,
  each payment stamped with its bill's `updated_at`. QBO `Payment` +
  `BillPayment` (CDC + `webhook.quickbooks.$companyId.ts`); Xero `/Payments` via a
  new `listChanges` (`If-Modified-Since`) + Invoice-update webhook accelerator.
- Gate: `isPaymentSyncbackEnabled(metadata, family)` — pull-back only when the
  family is in `documents` mode (`PostingSyncSettings.families`); `journals`/`none`
  means Carbon owns the payment (v3 Phase 4 pushes it outbound). `shouldSync` also
  benignly skips a payment whose settled document has no local mapping (ownership).

### Outbound payment write-back (Phase G — Rillet, Xero, QBO)

Payments executed OUTSIDE the provider (e.g. a bill paid through Ramp, recorded
in Carbon, or a manual Carbon payment) push back so the provider's bill/invoice
closes. `PaymentSyncerBase` gained a bespoke `pushToAccounting` (not the templated
fetchLocal→mapToRemote flow): it reads the Carbon `payment` + `invoiceSettlement`
directly, gates on the SAME documents-mode families gate as pull, and routes
per-record by the `payment` mapping — a payment that already carries a mapping is
provider-known and skips (the loop guard: a pulled payment links its mapping
BEFORE post-payment flips it to Posted, so its Posted event finds the mapping and
skips). A mapping-less Carbon-born payment is pushed via the provider adapter
`pushRemotePayment` (one provider payment per settled document), then linked under
the composite id with `metadata.origin = "carbon"` so a later void echoes out and
a later pull no-ops. `supportsPaymentPush` gates the whole thing — **Rillet, Xero,
AND QBO all set it true** (2026-08-14 parity). The capability set
`PAYMENT_PUSH_PROVIDERS` (`core/payment-syncer.ts`, must stay in sync with the
syncer flags) is what the reconcile executor and outbound sweep read instead of the
old `providerId === "rillet"` literal. Push validation controls supported
currency, funding and discount shapes; unsupported payments park as Skipped.
Rillet supports native voids for Carbon-origin payments: every persisted mapping
under the payment's single/fan-out identity is deleted remotely, then marked
`metadata.voided=true` in one local transaction. Mapping identities survive;
404 means the desired deletion already happened, while provider refusals remain
visible failures. Pulled/provider-origin payments never echo deletion. The paid date goes
through `toPostingDateString` (Kysely's pg driver returns DATE columns as JS
`Date`s; a bare `.slice` crashed the push). Provider adapters (`pushRemotePayment`):
**Rillet** `createInvoicePayment`/`createBillPayment` (`POST /{invoices,bills}/{id}/payments`,
flat body `{ amount, date, account_code }` — `date`, NOT `payment_date`; bill path
VERIFIED sandbox 2026-08-11). **Xero** `createPayment` (`PUT /Payments`
`{ Payments:[{ Invoice:{InvoiceID}, Account:{Code}, Amount, Date }] }` —
**live-VERIFIED sandbox 2026-08-14**: bill flipped to PAID; the Account must be a
Xero `Type:"BANK"` account, and `EnablePaymentsToAccount` is NOT the gate for bank
accounts). **QBO** AP `createBillPayment` / AR `createPayment` via `writeEntity`
(payload VERIFY-flagged — no QBO sandbox; needs `VendorRef`/`CustomerRef` +
`PayType`/`BankAccountRef` (AP) or `DepositToAccountRef` (AR)). Trigger: the
`payment` table has an event trigger (`20260807152238_payment-event-trigger.sql`)
+ a `${provider}-sync` `payment` subscription from `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS`
convergence (now Rillet/Xero/QBO; no migration backfill — see the subscriptions
section); the reconciler enqueues push only on a transition to Posted/Voided. (Phase G design lived in the
removed v2 engine spec; the behavior is documented in this section — see git for history.)

## Document representation model (bills, invoices, items)

AR/AP **documents** preserve Carbon's component amounts and account effects.
Base-currency GL parity also requires the provider to accept Carbon's FX snapshot.
Rillet uses REVENUE_RECOGNITION_ONLY invoices with a fixed rate and same-day
recognition; AR_ONLY ignores the invoice rate and initially credits deferred
revenue, so it cannot mirror Carbon's posting. Spec:
`.ai/specs/implemented/2026-08-05-accounting-document-representation.md`.

- **AP bills = account-costed replay of the posted "Purchase Invoice" journal**,
  NOT the item's account. `core/document-costing.ts` is the shared core:
  `loadBillCostingLines(db, { companyId, billId })` reads the
  posted journal (`journal.sourceType='Purchase Invoice'`, `status='Posted'`),
  excludes original AP/IC control rows using `classifyAccountingPostingRole` from
  `@carbon/utils` (never today's payables default), and returns base-currency debit-signed
  `CostingLine[]` (+ `currencyCode`/`exchangeRate`, document total, base currency and precision). Item labels are joined via
  `journalLine.documentLineReference` (`purchase-invoice:<purchaseOrderLineId>`
  → `purchaseOrderLine.itemId` → `item`); direct no-PO / variance lines have
  `sourceItem: undefined`. `toTransactionCurrencyLines(lines, {exchangeRate, documentTotal, decimalPlaces})`
  multiplies base values by the foreign-per-base rate, rounds at document
  currency precision, and reconciles only a permitted rounding residual to the
  largest absolute line; its storage envelope derives from shared `SCALE`.
  Identity conversion also rounds; signed PPV is retained. The item is a **description
  label only** (`costingLineItemLabel`). Bill lines are **tax-neutral** (the
  purchase posting folds tax into cost): Rillet no `tax_rate`, QBO no
  `TxnTaxDetail`, Xero `TaxType: "NONE"`. FX bills pin the provider rate
  (Rillet named `exchange_rate` object, QBO `CurrencyRef` + reciprocal
  `ExchangeRate = 1/r`, Xero `CurrencyRate = r`, including foreign 1:1 snapshots).
  Rillet's directed pair is document currency → subsidiary base currency at
  `1/r`, not Carbon's base → document convention. Foreign1:1 must stay explicit.
  This direction is verified against the sandbox's independent journal report.
  Every bill syncer has a posted-status `shouldSync` (Draft excluded — no
  journal to replay). Missing original journal/control/account metadata throws
  the structured `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` Warning before numeric reconciliation.
  A genuine costing amount discrepancy remains a failure. Provider builders
  accept costing-only rows and do not repeat the AP filter.
  - QBO bill emits `AccountBasedExpenseLineDetail` from a NEW bill-only builder
    (`buildQboBillLines`); it no longer uses the shared `buildQboExpenseLines`
    or `ensureDependencySynced("item")`. Xero bill uses `buildXeroBillLineItems`.
    Rillet bill (`mapBillToRilletBill`) is the reference (prepends the label;
    QBO/Xero substitute it). Account codes resolve through the shared
    `loadAccountCodesById` (Xero) / `loadQboAccountRefsById` (QBO) /
    `loadRilletAccountCodesById` (Rillet).
- **AR invoices preserve separate sales, shipping and native tax components.**
  `core/sales-invoice-source.ts` is the single typed batch loader for all three
  invoice adapters: authoritative view totals, add-ons, line/header shipping,
  group-scoped currency metadata and the original posted Shipping Revenue
  account. `core/sales-document-components.ts` shares the internal posting
  breakdown, converts base amounts once and reconciles document rounding
  through `distributeRoundingResidual` (`@carbon/utils`) — **largest remainder,
  one minor unit per component**, ordered by component id so an exact tie
  resolves the same way whatever order the lines arrive in. Do NOT go back to
  concentrating the residual on a single component: that breaks the component's
  own percent/amount pair, and QBO's `tax = net × percent` preflight
  (`invoice-tax.ts`) then refuses the invoice with a message blaming the
  customer's tax configuration, which they cannot act on. A component's unit
  price is DERIVED from its reconciled net when the stored `convertedUnitPrice`
  mirror and the converted extension straddle a rounding tie (the two are
  rounded on independent float paths); it still refuses when no representable
  price can reproduce the net, which is a real quantity/total contradiction.
  Original journal reads scope company, document, source type and Posted
  status; the shared role selector excludes VOID descriptions. Missing or
  ambiguous original shipping accounts refuse sync before dependency writes.
  Changing defaults after posting cannot change the account used on retry.
  Merchandise and add-ons retain the item's existing sales mapping. QBO and
  Rillet provision reusable service/product helpers under `shippingItem`, keyed
  by the original shipping account (Rillet also includes base currency).
  Tax appears once through native provider fields; COGS stays on the pushed
  `Sales Shipment` journal.
  - Xero sends one monetary unit per component, keeping original quantity and
    unit price in Description. This preserves net and native tax for bulk
    quantities and fine unit prices. Actual invoice/bill POSTs use `unitdp=4`;
    amounts that cannot be represented at Xero's two-decimal monetary boundary
    are refused before document writes rather than rounded away. Tax magnitude
    cannot exceed the monetary line unit; exotic/negative taxable adjustments
    still need provider acceptance. [Xero rounding contract](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/rounding-in-xero/).
    CurrencyRate is omitted only for identical currencies; foreign 1:1 stays
    explicit. Preflight and mocked transports do not prove returned-provider
    totals; connected acceptance must compare those independently.
  - QBO US line `TAX`/`NON` values are documented protocol markers, so an
    untaxed US invoice does not require catalog marker rows. Nonzero US
    transaction tax rates and all non-US line codes still resolve from the
    real active catalog; missing/ambiguous configuration raises
    `UNMAPPED_TAX_CODES` before dependencies. Failed catalog reads evict the
    cached promise so another invoice can retry. [Intuit SDK tax contract](https://intuit.github.io/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK/quickstart.html#constructing-entities-with-tax).
  - Rillet REVENUE_RECOGNITION_ONLY accepts the same directed fixed rate as bills.
    Each item has a DAILY revenue period beginning and ending on Carbon's
    posting date, also used as the remote invoice/FX date. The interim
    deferred-revenue entries net to zero and recognition
    credits the mapped revenue account; shipping retains its original-account
    override. Native invoice/bill DELETE handles Carbon Voided status before
    the mapped-create idempotency shortcut. Reconciliation and the outbound
    sweep include mapped voided documents/payments, and mapping tombstones stop
    repeated deletes. Compare independent remote GL, including recognition
    and reversal, instead of treating create HTTP200 as accounting parity.
- **Provider items are non-tracked** so the provider never posts inventory
  (bills) or COGS (invoices): Xero pushes `IsTrackedAsInventory: false` on
  create and OMITS the flag on update (Xero rejects untracking an item with
  stock/txns; a still-tracked remote logs a recorded warning to untrack
  manually). QBO items are Service/NonInventory (never Inventory).
- **PO / SO / Quote are unchanged** — item-referenced, no GL constraint (QBO PO
  keeps `buildQboExpenseLines` / `ItemBasedExpenseLineDetail`).

## Card charges as provider objects (`charge` entity)

A Carbon `cardTransaction` (Ramp card spend, `.claude/rules/ramp-integration.md`) is
pushed as each provider's **native card-charge object** instead of an opaque journal
entry — Rillet `POST /charges`, QBO `Purchase` with `PaymentType: "CreditCard"`, Xero
`BankTransactions` `Type: "SPEND"` on the `CREDITCARD` bank account. Every one of them
derives the same posting Carbon's `Card Transaction` journal already books (debit the
coded lines, credit the card liability), so the switch carries no GL-drift risk and
recovers the merchant (vendor) and dimensions the journal path dropped. Ramp receipts stay
on Carbon `document` rows; Rillet additionally uploads them best-effort after create, while
the Xero and QBO charge adapters do not currently attach remote files. Entity type `charge`
(`AccountingEntityType`, `ENTITY_DEFINITIONS`,
`DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG`, `SyncConfigSchema`); table map `cardTransaction → charge`
(`events/sync-tables.ts`); subscription `{ table: "cardTransaction", INSERT/UPDATE }`
in `COMMON_PUSH_TABLES` for all three providers; the event trigger and tenant-safe
`supplierId` relationship are converged by
`20260919152233_ramp-integration.sql` (no subscription backfill —
runtime subscription convergence). Syncers:
`providers/rillet/entities/charge.ts` (`RilletChargeSyncer`, reference), plus the Xero
and QBO adapters cloned from their bill syncers. Costing lines come from the shared
`loadCardTransactionCostingLines` (`core/document-costing.ts`): the posted journal's
coded lines minus the card-liability line (identified by the header's `cardAccountId`,
not a description role), base-currency debit-signed, with dimensions.

**Per-row policy, not per source type.** `POSTING_POLICY["Card Transaction"]` stays
`representation: "journal"`; `getJournalPostingPolicyDecision` (`core/posting.ts`)
carries an additive carve-out beside the Inventory Adjustment one:
`isChargeBackedCardTransaction({ type, hasSupplier }, docSync)` → `DOC_BACKED` with
`backingDocument: { entityType: "charge" }` only when the `charge` entity is enabled
AND the row is a `Charge` with a supplier (or a `Credit` where the provider is in
`CHARGE_CREDIT_PROVIDERS` — Xero, QBO and Rillet; Rillet posts a Credit as a charge with
NEGATIVE items, which its sandbox accepted on 2026-09-10). `Payment` / `Cashback` / `Repayment` rows (card-liability ↔ bank movements, no
vendor) and a Charge with no merchant supplier keep pushing as journal entries. The
executor (`reconcile-executor.ts`) and the event planner (`planJournalPostingOperation`)
resolve the backing row through the shared `loadCardTransactionPolicyInputs`
(`accounting-sync-operations.ts`): **journal LINES → `documentType = 'Card Transaction'`,
`documentId = cardTransaction.id`**, then one `cardTransaction` query per batch (`type,
supplierId`), with `cardTransaction.journalId` only as a fallback for unlinked journals.
The line link is what the posting journal AND the "VOID Card Transaction" journal share —
the void is a NEW Posted journal (`post-card-transaction`, no `reversalOfId`), so keying on
`cardTransaction.journalId` resolved only the original and the void pushed as a plain
journal entry on top of the charge DELETE, netting Rillet to minus one charge (found live
2026-09-10, fixed the same day). Each charge syncer's `shouldSync` mirrors the same rule, so
the spend reaches the provider as exactly one of the two, never both and never neither. Already-
synced journals are never re-planned (`reconcileJournal` skips covered rows).
Statuses: `SWEPT_CHARGE_STATUSES = ["Posted", "Voided"]`; the sweep pages
`cardTransaction` by `transactionDate` (+ `voidedAt` for late voids) filtered to
`type IN ('Charge','Credit')`. `ChargeSyncerBase` handles the lifecycle uniformly: a
successful create is mapped before the batch advances; a mapped Void invokes the provider's
native delete and tombstones the mapping only after the provider confirms it. Rillet uses
`DELETE /charges/{id}` (**live-verified 2026-09-10**: GET → 404); Xero rereads the complete
bank transaction and POSTs that resource with `Status: DELETED`; QBO performs the required
`POST /purchase?operation=delete` with its current `SyncToken`. The Xero/QBO paths follow their official
contracts but still need live sandbox verification. A Voided charge without a durable remote
id fails closed as `UNCONFIRMED_REMOTE_VOID` for manual provider verification rather than
claiming success. QBO's
`DepartmentRef` is header-level on a `Purchase` (only `ClassRef` is per line) and its
`TxnDate` is the posting date (already period-shifted by the Ramp sync). Both
adapters use provider-prefixed aliases (`XeroCardCharge`, `QboCardCharge`) of the shared
`CardChargeSource` in `core/card-charge-source.ts`; the shared loader batches tenant- and
provider-scoped local rows for one drain. Create retry identity is provider-specific and
stable: Rillet's entity-scoped idempotency key, Xero's deterministic Carbon `Reference` lookup
plus its six-minute idempotency key, and QBO's deterministic `requestid`. QBO retains sparse
updates with `SyncToken` retry. Each successful item links immediately, so a later item failure
cannot lose the earlier remote identity.

**Rillet charge — live-verified 2026-09-10 on the sandbox** (`.ai/plans/2026-09-19-ramp-integration.md` Part C): `POST /charges` lands with `vendor_id` (the merchant vendor, JIT-synced), one item per coded line (`account_code`, amount, `fields[]` = the auto-provisioned Cost Center Field + value), `charge_date` = transaction date, `impact_date` = posting date, both `external_references`. Two preconditions a customer must meet, both surfaced truthfully rather than guessed: (1) every account on the charge must be mapped (Account Mapping tab → "Match by code"), else Warning `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` naming the ids; (2) **the Carbon account chosen as Ramp's card liability must map to a Rillet account of subtype "Credit Card"** — Rillet rejects anything else with `400 "Account <code> is not a credit card account"` (recorded as Failed with that message; remap and Retry). Rillet IS in `CHARGE_CREDIT_PROVIDERS`: a `Credit` (Delta refund) posts as a charge whose items are negative and its journal records `Excluded/DOC_BACKED/charge` — one representation, never both (before the flip it verifiably closed Skipped with the journal pushed instead, so the mirror holds both ways).
The tie-out needs nothing new: `getBackingDocumentDelivery` is entity-type-generic and
`journalLine.documentId` already carries the `cardTransaction.id`.

`cardTransaction.supplierId` (same migration) is the merchant resolved to a Carbon
supplier by the Ramp sync (`resolveMerchantSupplier`: mapping under entityType
`merchant` by Ramp `merchant_id` → exact-name match to an existing supplier → the
single `"Card Merchant"` **house supplier** per company — never one supplier per
merchant; see `.ai/specs/2026-09-19-ramp-integration.md`); the existing
vendor syncers carry it to the provider via `ensureDependencySynced("vendor")`. Since
card spend collapses to that catch-all vendor, each charge adapter now sets the charge
**line description** to `charge.merchantName ?? line.description ?? charge.memo` so the
pushed charge still shows which merchant the spend was at.

**Ramp inbound financial records are staged transactionally.** Card transactions and bills
advisory-lock a company/Ramp id and atomically stage their Draft header, lines, supporting
rows, and mapping before calling the posting edge function; ambiguous responses require a
tenant-scoped reread proving `Posted`. Single-PO bills preserve exact covered-line provenance
and quantity, while multi-PO bills remain standalone instead of choosing an arbitrary order.
Mapped card Drafts refresh their header and coding from validated Ramp input atomically;
Posted cards cannot be rewritten. The card-post handler binds authenticated permission checks
to the JWT subject. Payment/Cashback reject coding lines they would otherwise ignore, and
Charge/Credit/Repayment require finite positive line magnitudes. Post and reversal allocate
journal-line ids before insertion, so dimension linkage never depends on RETURNING order.

Bill payments and reimbursements follow the same rule.
`ramp-sync-bill.ts` owns the bill-payment drain/confirm family and delegates each item to
`syncRampBillPayment` in `ramp-sync-payment.ts`. `stageRampPaymentDraft` writes or resumes
the Draft `payment`, `invoiceSettlement`, and Ramp mapping in one Kysely transaction while
preserving the stored source-FX snapshot; `createOrResumeRampPayment` posts and accepts an
ambiguous edge-function response only when a tenant-scoped reread shows the payment is
Posted. Card-backed bill payments are confirmed without an AP payment because the card
transaction already represents the cash movement.
The explicit card set includes `ONE_TIME_CARD_DELIVERY`; only documented bank rails enter
the AP bank-payment path. Unknown methods, vendor credits, manual payments, and other
unmapped funding semantics fail visibly rather than becoming a statement-bank payment.
`ramp-sync-reimbursement-family.ts` owns listing and confirmation and delegates an item to
`syncRampReimbursement` in `ramp-sync-reimbursement.ts`. The staging helper uses an
advisory lock scoped to the company and Ramp reimbursement id, then
`stageOrResumeRampReimbursementInvoice` atomically creates the supplier interaction, Draft
purchase invoice, delivery, lines, and mapping. It may adopt only one unposted system Draft
whose expected Ramp reference, supplier, dates, currency, complete delivery/line structure,
coding and amounts match, with valid preserved FX, zero tax/shipping, and no PO/item/asset
provenance. Partial or mismatched reference-only invoices are rejected without rewriting.
The family confirms Ramp only after the
invoice, and the payment when Ramp-paid, are observably Posted. Do not split either staged
write set into Supabase-client calls; those calls do not form a transaction.
`REIMBURSED` and `REIMBURSED_VIA_PUSH` require that payment; the supported invoice-only
states are `APPROVED`, `AWAITING_PAYMENT`, `AWAITING_PUSH_PAYMENT`, and
`MANUALLY_REIMBURSED`. Other states fail before any financial write. Repayment funding is
also explicit: only documented lowercase `ach` currently selects the bank offset; unknown
or statement-credit funding cannot fall through to a bank account.

Ramp outbound invoice export ships as a coded DRAFT-only bill push (live-verified
2026-09-11; the old release gate is gone). Like the AP bills pushed to QBO/Xero/Rillet, its
lines are the **account-costed replay of the posted "Purchase Invoice" journal**
(`loadBillCostingLines` + `toTransactionCurrencyLines`), NOT `purchaseInvoiceLine.accountId`
(null for item lines). Carbon `POST /bills/drafts` with `remote_id` (the echo guard +
bill-match key the inbound bill step dedupes on; Ramp 422s `enable_accounting_sync: false`
alongside a remote_id, and a draft is not in the `/bills` feed anyway), decimal
document-currency line amounts, per-line coding on Ramp's `"Category"` GL field + the custom
`"carbon-cost-center"` field, and NEVER submits (submit needs per-vendor Ramp payment config
Carbon doesn't own). Foreign-currency invoices require a finite positive
stored rate. Supplier lookup errors and failed pushes retain their outbound cursor
positions. There is no bill archive-on-settlement — a Ramp draft has no delete endpoint, so
Ramp owns the bill lifecycle after handoff (PO archive on Completed/Closed is separate).
Ramp ownership challenges require a valid body HMAC before callback or echo; query
parameters are unsigned and cannot supply the challenge. See `ramp-integration.md` for
these support boundaries.

**Rillet reimbursements.** A purchase invoice to an "Employee" supplier (what the
Ramp reimbursement sync creates) is ALWAYS written to `POST /reimbursements`, Rillet's
native object, never to `/bills` — there is deliberately no setting for it (one was
built and removed the same day: an unnecessary choice). `RilletBillSyncer` routes in
`upsertRemote` (pure `toRilletReimbursement(billPayload, payableAccountCode)`; the
payable is the AP control account of the posted journal, now returned by
`loadBillCostingLines` as `payablesAccountId`), stamps the mapping
`metadata.remoteKind = "reimbursement"` in `linkEntities`, and `deleteRemote(remoteId,
metadata)` — the base now passes the mapping metadata — deletes the right object on
void. Rillet publishes **no reimbursement-payment endpoint** (2026-09-10; the schema
exists in its spec without a path), so `RilletPaymentSyncer.pushRemotePayment` parks a
payout against such a bill as Warning `UNSUPPORTED_REIMBURSEMENT_PAYMENT` — visible, and
retryable once Rillet ships the endpoint; until then the reimbursement is marked paid in
Rillet by hand — rather than 404ing on `/bills/{id}/payments`. **Both live-verified
2026-09-10**: `POST /reimbursements` (vendor JIT-created, item on the coded account,
`reimbursement_date` = `dateIssued`, mapping `remoteKind: reimbursement`, status UNPAID) and
the parked payout Warning on a posted Carbon AP payment. The AP control account must be
mapped too (`payable_account_code`).

## Dimensions (journal / bill analytics)

Journal-entry and bill line dimensions (`journalLineDimension`) map to provider
analytics fields. **Rillet sends ALL dimensions on every line and auto-provisions
what's missing** — there is no per-company slot/cap (Rillet Fields are unlimited).
`RilletTransactionSyncer.resolveLineDimensions(lines)` (`providers/rillet/entities/shared.ts`)
resolves each distinct dimension to a Rillet Field id (reuse an existing Field by
name, else `createField(name, "EXPENSES")` — journal entries + bills are
expense-side) and each value to a Field-value id (`upsertFieldValue` by the
value's readable label), persisting both in `externalIntegrationMapping`
(`entityType` `"dimension"` for the Field via `upsertDimensionMapping`,
`"dimensionValue"` for the value). The Rillet mappers iterate `line.dimensions`;
a dimension whose Field or value can't be provisioned is dropped from that line's
refs. `createField` (`POST /fields`) is VERIFY-flagged — confirm the payload on
the Rillet sandbox.

**Xero/QBO keep the slot system** (`dimensionSlots` + `maxJournalDimensionSlots`
= 2 each; `validateDimensionSlots`, the Dimensions settings tab). For Rillet the
slot config is now inert (the mapper no longer reads it) — the tab's slot editor
is dead config for Rillet only, left in place for the capped providers.

## Gotchas

- All DB writes during sync are wrapped in `withTriggersDisabled(database, tx => ...)` to break the loop (sync writes DB → event trigger → sync again). Since migration `20260811224732`, that suppression is **scoped**: `dispatch_event_batch()` drops only SYNC/WEBHOOK/WORKFLOW subscriptions while `app.sync_in_progress` is set (the loop/echo-prone types); SEARCH/AUDIT/EMBEDDING observers now see sync-written rows (v4 F13). **Exception:** payment sync-back invokes `post-payment` *outside* that tx (triggers enabled), like a user posting a payment — intended.
- Rillet create POSTs carry a deterministic, **entity-scoped** `Idempotency-Key`: `buildRilletIdempotencyKey` (`providers/rillet/provider.ts`) = sha256 of `companyId:operation:localId`; Rillet replays the stored response for 24h. The payload is deliberately **NOT hashed** (v4 Pillar C): a crash between the remote create and the local mapping write retries with a possibly-drifted payload, and a payload-sensitive key would mint a fresh key and duplicate the remote document. Contract pinned by `providers/rillet/__tests__/provider.test.ts`.
- The event-queue drainer (`events/queue.ts`) archives unknown-`handlerType` messages to pgmq's dead-letter table (`pgmq.a_event_system`) instead of crash-looping the whole drain (v4 F8) — a poison message can no longer wedge ALL event processing.
- `ContactSyncer.getRemoteId` checks both `customer` and `vendor` mappings (one Xero Contact backs both).
- Transaction syncers (PO, invoice, bill) use `ensureDependencySynced(type, localId)` for JIT dependency syncing (e.g. push the customer before its invoice); `dependsOn` is declared in `ENTITY_DEFINITIONS`.
- DELETE is entity-specific rather than generic: mapped documents/payments and native card
  charges implement provider-aware void/delete paths where supported; unsupported or
  unconfirmed deletes fail or park visibly and never receive a false tombstone.
- Don't hand-edit generated DB types; read the newest migration for schema truth.

## Rillet contact import (on-demand pull)

`rillet-import-contacts.ts` + `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/integrations.rillet.import-contacts.ts`,
reached from the **Import customers & vendors** action on the Rillet integration
settings page (`actions` in `packages/ee/src/rillet/config.tsx`).

Seeds Carbon from a Rillet organization that already has contacts, and — the actual
point — writes the `externalIntegrationMapping` rows. `RilletCustomerSyncer.upsertRemote`
resolves `getRemoteId(localId)` before writing, so once a Carbon customer is linked, a
sales invoice raised in Carbon PUTs the ORIGINAL Rillet customer instead of creating a
second one. Same for vendors and bills.

- The job lists customers and vendors in ONE step (Rillet cursors expire after 2 h and
  are never resumed), then enqueues `pull-from-accounting` ledger operations in batches
  of `IMPORT_BATCH_SIZE` and drains each batch through the shared `drainSyncOperations`.
  `concurrency: { key: "event.data.companyId", limit: 1 }` — two concurrent imports would
  race on the name-match ladder below.
- **Direction is NOT changed.** `buildRilletSyncConfig` still forces
  `push-to-accounting` / `owner: "carbon"` for both entities, so no sweep, webhook or
  event pulls a contact on its own. The ledger row's own `direction` is what routes the
  drain to `pullBatchFromAccounting` — the same override the inbound webhook path uses.
- **Re-running is safe at two levels.** A linked record is skipped by
  `pullBatchFromAccounting`'s `owner: "carbon"` gate (Rillet never overwrites a
  Carbon-owned record), and an unlinked one resolves through `upsertLocal`'s match ladder:
  mapping row → the Carbon id on the record's own `carbon` external_reference (qualified
  by `carbon-company`, so another Carbon instance's colliding id is refused) → the name,
  which `customer_name_unique`/`supplier_name_unique (name, companyId)` makes a real key.
  A name match onto a supplier/customer already linked to a DIFFERENT Rillet record
  THROWS (named ids, visible in Sync Activity) rather than silently re-pointing the
  mapping.
- `RilletEntitySyncer` is now Rillet plumbing only; the pull rejections moved to
  `RilletPushOnlyEntitySyncer`, which `RilletItemSyncer` and `RilletTransactionSyncer`
  extend. Customer and vendor extend `RilletEntitySyncer` and implement
  `mapToLocal`/`upsertLocal`.
- `fetchRemoteBatch` on both syncers reads ONE cursor-drained list for a multi-id batch
  and keeps the direct GET for a single id — Rillet has no get-many endpoint, so the
  alternative is N GETs. The list is memoized on the **provider** (`listCustomers`/
  `listVendors` in `provider.ts`), and the import builds ONE provider and reuses it for
  the id-listing step and every batch, so the full drain per entity type runs once for
  the whole import instead of once per 50-id batch (the drain builds a fresh syncer per
  batch, so per-syncer memoization alone would rescan). A failed list is not cached, so a
  retried batch can list again. On an Inngest replay the list step is skipped and the
  provider is fresh, so the first re-executing batch re-lists once — bounded, never
  per-batch.
- A Rillet contact email that collides with an existing same-class contact
  (`contact_email_companyId_unique (email, companyId, isCustomer)`, and `contact.email`
  is nullable) is **skipped**, not created/filled — the insert or fill-missing UPDATE
  would throw inside the shared pull transaction and roll back the mapping the import
  exists to write. The contact is secondary; the checked-up-front guard covers both the
  insert and the fill branches.
- **Not imported:** addresses (`address.countryCode` is an FK to `country.alpha2`, and a
  free-text Rillet country would fail the whole row) and payment terms (Carbon's is an FK
  to `paymentTerm`, and the outbound mapper does not read it either). A contact person is
  created only when Rillet carries an email — a Rillet contact has no person name, so
  with no email there is nothing a contact row would say that the customer row does not.
