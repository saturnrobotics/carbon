# Accounting Sync Handlers

Syncs Carbon entities <-> external accounting providers. **Three live providers**: Xero (`ProviderID.XERO`), QuickBooks Online (`ProviderID.QBO`), and Rillet (`ProviderID.RILLET`). (QuickBooks *Desktop* shipped then was removed 2026-08-01; Sage was never built.) `SyncFactory` is a **provider-keyed registry** (`registries[providerId][entityType]`) — each provider's `index.ts` barrel calls `SyncFactory.register(...)`. Runs on **Inngest** (the old trigger.dev `from-/to-accounting-sync` task design is gone — do not look for `UPSERT_MAP`/`DELETE_MAP` or a `trigger/` dir; neither exists).

Design specs: `.ai/specs/2026-08-12-accounting-sync-reconciler-unification.md` (v5 — ONE state-shaped decision core; events are hints; the authoritative design of record) and `.ai/specs/implemented/2026-08-05-accounting-document-representation.md` (AR/AP documents replay their posting journal; provider items non-tracked). The superseded v2/v3/v4 specs (engine + ledger + pull sweep + Phase F/G payment sync-back; journal policy/dimensions/tie-out; delivery robustness — converged subscriptions, truthful ledger, outbound sweep, tie-out enforcement) were removed 2026-08-13 — their shipped behavior is documented in THIS rule; their history is in git. **Always-on (implemented 2026-08-13, plan `.ai/plans/2026-08-13-accounting-sync-automated-postings-only.md` Tasks 1–6+8):** posting sync mirrors Carbon's automated GL postings whenever an accounting integration is connected — no master `postingSync.enabled` toggle, no per-source-type on/off, no `journalEntry` entity gate (defaulted on in `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG` and forced on in every `build*SyncConfig`). `Manual` and `Opening Balance` journals NEVER sync (`POSTING_POLICY[...].syncable: false` → the `MANUAL_DISABLED` exclude at `posting.ts`; the external ledger owns manual journals and its own opening balances). Note the exclude `reason`/`message` are still worded "Manual" for both — the gate is `syncable === false`, not a name check. Legacy `enabled` fields stay in the stored schema for parse-compat but are never read; per-type granularity (individual vs daily-summary) remains the only per-type setting. Plan Tasks 7 (reversal/void propagation audit) and 9 (lock AR/AP families to documents) remain open.

## Architecture: class-per-entity syncers, not a handler map

The sync engine lives in `packages/ee/src/accounting/` (package `@carbon/ee/accounting`):
- `core/sync.ts` — `SyncFactory.getSyncer(context)` returns the right syncer by `providerId` + `entityType` from the registry.
- `core/types.ts` — `BaseEntitySyncer<TLocal, TRemote, TOmit>` abstract base (~800 lines). Implements `pushToAccounting` / `pullFromAccounting` (+ `*Batch*`) with: mapping lookup, `shouldSync` gate, fast-bailout on unchanged timestamps, `mapToRemote`/`mapToLocal`, then `withTriggersDisabled` DB write + `linkEntities`. Also `SupportsIncrementalPull` (`listChanges({since}) → ProviderChange[]`) — the pull-sweep contract (QBO CDC, Rillet `updated.gt`, Xero `/Payments` `If-Modified-Since`).
- `providers/{xero,quickbooks-online,rillet}/entities/*.ts` — concrete syncers. Xero `ContactSyncer` backs both `customer` AND `vendor`; QBO/Rillet have separate Customer + Vendor syncers. Each provider has item/bill/invoice(+PO/journalEntry) syncers and a **`PaymentSyncer`** (see Payment sync-back below). `employee` is not implemented.
- `core/external-mapping.ts` — `ExternalIntegrationMappingService` / `createMappingService(db, companyId)`: all ID linking goes through the `externalIntegrationMapping` table.
- `core/models.ts` — Zod schemas, `ProviderID`, `AccountingSyncSchema`, `ENTITY_DEFINITIONS`, `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG`, `PostingSyncSettings` (`families.ar`/`families.ap` = `documents|journals|none`).
- `core/service.ts` — `getAccountingIntegration()` (reads `companyIntegration` row) + `getProviderIntegration()` (instantiates the right provider; applies the merged per-company `syncConfig`).

## Entity types & directions

`AccountingEntityType` = `customer | vendor | item | employee | purchaseOrder | bill | salesOrder | invoice | payment | inventoryAdjustment | journalEntry`. `payment` is `dependsOn: ['invoice','bill']` and **two-way** (Phase G): provider-recorded payments pull back (Phase F) and Carbon-born Posted payments push out as provider payment documents. Routing is per-record by origin (the `payment` mapping), not a static direction — see Payment sync-back.

`SyncDirection` = `"two-way" | "push-to-accounting" | "pull-from-accounting"` (NOT the old `from-/to-/bi-directional`). Each entity has an `EntityConfig { enabled, direction, owner: "carbon" | "accounting", syncFromDate? }`. Per-entity defaults live in `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG`, deep-merged with the company's stored `syncConfig`; providers then force an entity's config in their `build{Xero,Qbo,Rillet}SyncConfig`. **Carbon owns everything** is the standardized stance: every provider forces the master + document entities `customer`/`vendor`/`item`/`invoice`/`bill` to `push-to-accounting` / `owner: "carbon"` (`XERO_CARBON_OWNED_ENTITIES`, `QBO_CARBON_OWNED_ENTITIES`, Rillet's `RILLET_PUSH_ONLY_ENTITIES`) — the provider is a downstream mirror. `payment` is the one accounting-owned exception (forced `pull-from-accounting` / `owner: "accounting"`; Rillet two-way for Phase G push-back). There is **no** per-entity "Source of Truth" setting — it was removed; `owner` is provider-forced, not user-configurable. `owner` decides the winner on conflict: for a Carbon-owned entity, an inbound provider change to an already-linked record is skipped (`BaseEntitySyncer.pullBatchFromAccounting`, `core/types.ts`). Note the webhook path sends an explicit `pull-from-accounting` that overrides `direction`, so a net-new record created directly in the provider can still be ingested — `owner: "carbon"` only guards *linked* records; QBO's CDC pull-sweep (`listChanges`) does honor `direction` and skips push-only entities entirely.

## Inngest functions (entry points)

These live in `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/integrations/` (+ `events/sync.ts`), exported via that dir's `index.ts`, and registered in `packages/jobs/src/inngest/index.ts`. Event-name <-> trigger-key map: `packages/lib/src/trigger.ts` & `packages/lib/src/events.ts`. Fire with `trigger("<key>", payload)`.

| Inngest id | event | file | trigger key / fired from |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sync-external-accounting` | `carbon/sync-external-accounting` | `sync-external-accounting.ts` | `sync-external-accounting`; fired by the inbound webhooks — `webhook.xero.ts`, `webhook.rillet.$companyId.ts`, `webhook.quickbooks.$companyId.ts` |
| `accounting-pull-sweep` | — | `accounting-pull-sweep.ts` | cron `*/30 * * * *`; iterates every active integration that implements `SupportsIncrementalPull` (`listChanges`) — the **INBOUND correctness guarantee** behind the webhooks (webhooks are latency, not correctness) |
| `accounting-outbound-sweep` | — | `accounting-outbound-sweep.ts` | cron `15,45 * * * *` (offset from the pull sweep) — the **OUTBOUND correctness guarantee** (v4 Pillar B); see the sweep section below |
| `accounting-backfill` | `carbon/accounting-backfill` | `accounting-backfill.ts` | `accounting-backfill` |
| `accounting-consolidation` | — | `accounting-consolidation.ts` | cron `0 2 * * *`; pushes one aggregated provider journal per posting date for daily-consolidation configs (drains hold those journal ops for it) |
| `accounting-reconciliation` | — | `accounting-reconciliation.ts` | cron `0 3 * * 1` (Mondays 03:00 UTC) — presence drift check + `accountingSyncTieOut` writer; see the tie-out section below |
| `event-handler-sync` | `carbon/event-sync` | `events/sync.ts` | the SYNC event-system handler (see event-system.md) — DB writes -> push to the provider |

### The operation ledger — enqueue, cooldown, truthful close

Every entry point routes through the durable **`accountingSyncOperation`** ledger (`accounting-sync-operations.ts` in jobs + `core/operations.ts` in ee) between enqueue and `SyncFactory.getSyncer(...).pushBatch/pullBatch`:

- **Enqueue.** `enqueueSyncOperations` absorbs re-triggers into the live (Pending/In Flight) row. The v5 reconcile path enqueues with trigger `"reconcile"`, which is **never cooldown-gated** — a state-derived decision is idempotent, so an unchanged entity decides `nothing` instead of needing a window, and a changed one enqueues immediately. The 60s completed-row cooldown (`SYNC_OPERATION_COOLDOWN_MS`, `isCooldownTrigger`: `event`/`webhook`) survives ONLY on the inbound/webhook entry points (`sync-external-accounting`, the pull sweep), which don't route through the reconciler. `isStatusTransitionEvent` and `getPaymentPushDecision` were deleted with v5 (nothing to bypass; payment state lives in the decision core).
- **Drain.** `drainSyncOperations` claims Pending (+ stale In Flight) rows in groups of (entityType, direction); an op claimed more than `MAX_SYNC_OPERATION_ATTEMPTS` (10) times parks as `Failed` `ATTEMPTS_EXHAUSTED` instead of running again (a human Retry resets the loop deliberately).
- **Truthful close (v4 Pillar C).** `getSyncOperationCloseDecision` decides how a claimed op closes: syncer `skipped` WITH a `remoteId` (fast-bailout, already linked) → `Completed` stamping that externalId; `skipped` WITHOUT one (shouldSync gate, disabled entity, parked payment) → `Skipped` via `skipOperation` (reason in `errorMessage`, `errorCode` null so the UI renders it neutrally); push `success` WITHOUT a `remoteId` → `Failed` `POSTCONDITION` (a push success must produce an external id/mapping — recording it green is the phantom-success bug). A no-op is never recorded `Completed`. `Skipped → Pending` is an allowed transition (`SYNC_OPERATION_ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS`, `core/models.ts` — Retry covers the drain's machine no-op closes too). Batch AND single pushes preserve structured `JournalEntrySyncError` failures via `toSyncResultError` (`core/types.ts`), so e.g. `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` lands as a Warning with metadata instead of a flattened Failed string.

`sync-external-accounting.ts` flow: parse `AccountingSyncSchema` → `getAccountingIntegration` → `getProviderIntegration` → enqueue one ledger op per entity + direction (trigger: `webhook` syncs keep `"webhook"`, scheduled/trigger syncs enqueue as `"event"`; both respect the completed-row cooldown) → drain. Returns `{ success, enqueue, drain }` summaries.

`events/sync.ts` (v5) treats events as **hints, not decisions**: it maps DB table → entity type via `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` in **`events/sync-tables.ts`** (import-light on purpose — no Inngest/env boot — so the subscriptions invariant test can import it): `customer→customer`, `supplier→vendor`, `item→item`, `purchaseOrder→purchaseOrder`, `purchaseInvoice→bill`, `salesInvoice→invoice`, `salesOrder→salesOrder`, `journal→journalEntry`, `payment→payment`; dedupes the batch into `(entityType, entityId)` refs (DELETEs logged/skipped — a deleted row also reconciles to nothing), and calls the same `reconcileEntities` executor the outbound sweep uses, then drains. There are no per-table decision branches here anymore — what happens is decided by `computeReconcileDecision` from CURRENT state, never from the event's old/new delta. Wrapped in `step.run` per company+provider for checkpointing.

## Event subscriptions — code-derived, converged (v4 Pillar A)

`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/subscriptions.ts` (exported from the `./accounting` barrel) is the single source of truth for the SYNC event-system subscriptions each provider's outbound sync needs: `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS[providerId]` + the idempotent `ensureProviderSubscriptions(client, companyId, providerId)` (the create RPC upserts on `(companyId, name, table)`; rows for tables no longer required are deleted). Subscription name: `${providerId}-sync` (`getSyncSubscriptionName`).

- **Converged from three call sites** — the install hook, the `onUpdate` hook (every settings save of an installed integration), and the outbound sweep — so existing installs self-heal at runtime. **No migration ever backfills subscription rows**; migrations only attach table triggers (`20260807152238_payment-event-trigger.sql` is the precedent).
- **The set**: every provider gets `customer`/`supplier`/`item`/`salesInvoice`/`purchaseInvoice` (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) + `journal` (INSERT/UPDATE only — journals are immutable once posted and DELETE sync doesn't exist). all three providers add `payment` (INSERT/UPDATE — Phase G outbound push, now Rillet/Xero/QBO); Xero adds `purchaseOrder` + `salesOrder`; QBO adds `purchaseOrder` only. **`address` is deliberately absent everywhere** — address edits reach sync via the parent-row `updatedAt` bump interceptor; a direct address subscription is a dead letter.
- Provider hooks (`packages/ee/src/{rillet,xero,quickbooks}/hooks.server.ts`) are thin wrappers over the convergence. The QBO install hook is **no longer a no-op** (its syncers shipped), and `quickbooksOnUninstall` exists. `onUpdate` is a new `IntegrationServerHooks` member (`packages/ee/src/types.ts`; registry `packages/ee/src/hooks.server.ts`; wired in `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/settings+/integrations.$id.tsx`).
- **Invariant test**: `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/events/subscriptions-mapping.test.ts` pins every subscribed table ↔ a `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` entry (`events/sync-tables.ts`) ↔ a registered syncer for that provider — a subscription that routes nowhere fails CI. (`salesOrder` got its map entry as part of this; it was a dead Xero subscription before.)

## Outbound reconciliation sweep (v4 Pillar B)

Doctrine, mirroring the inbound pull sweep: **events are latency; the sweep is outbound correctness.** Any lost event (missing subscription, queue loss, cooldown swallow, phantom Completed) becomes ≤30-min staleness, never permanent loss. `accounting-outbound-sweep.ts` (cron `15,45 * * * *`), per company with an active accounting integration:

1. **Subscription convergence** — `ensureProviderSubscriptions` (the self-healing invariant check; runs first so a repaired install's next events flow normally).
2. **Candidate refs (scope, not decisions)** — pages posted journals (Posted/Reversed, `reversalOfId` null), posted documents (`SWEPT_BILL_STATUSES`/`SWEPT_INVOICE_STATUSES` — the posted set minus the transient mid-posting `Pending`), posted payments (Rillet only), and parked `Warning UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` bills regardless of window. Window floor: `getSweepFloorDate` = today − `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (7), raised to the entity's `syncFromDate` — deliberately short; history beyond it is the explicit backfill's job.
3. **Reconcile** — every ref goes to `reconcileEntities` (the SAME executor the event path calls); the decisions (missing-remotely enqueue incl. the phantom Completed-without-mapping repair, policy exclusions, the capped `MAX_REDRIVE_ATTEMPTS` re-drive when a bill's posted "Purchase Invoice" journal now exists) all live in `computeReconcileDecision`.
4. **Drain** — including what this run enqueued/re-drove. This is **Xero's only periodic drain** (it has no incremental pull), so UI retries stop rotting as Pending.
5. **Alert (Pillar F)** — failed ops left after the drain fire one in-app `NotificationEvent.IntegrationSync` to the integration's configurer (`integration.updatedBy`), linking to the integration's settings page. A notification failure never fails the sweep.

## The v5 reconciler (one brain)

- **`integrations/reconcile.ts`** — `computeReconcileDecision(input)`: the pure, state-shaped decision for every outbound entity (journals via the shared `planJournalPostingFromState` policy core; documents incl. the re-drive and the changed-since-failure retry; payments; master data via `updatedAt` vs `mapping.lastSyncedAt`). Import-light; exhaustively pinned by **`reconcile-golden.test.ts`** (spec Step A), whose FIX-1..4 entries document every deliberate difference from the legacy paths.
- **`integrations/reconcile-executor.ts`** — `reconcileEntities({refs, …})`: batch-first state loading (one query per concern per entity type — snapshots, ledger rows incl. `:reversal` twins, mappings, the parked-bill backing-journal join), then the pure decision per entity, then application through the existing ledger primitives with trigger `"reconcile"` (migration `20260812093418` widened the CHECK).
- Callers: `events/sync.ts` (hints) and the outbound sweep (window walk). The journal policy core is shared with `planJournalPostingOperation` (still used by the manual backfill), so policy routing cannot diverge between callers.

## Reconciliation + tie-out (v3 §5 / v4 Pillar E)

`accounting-reconciliation.ts` (cron `0 3 * * 1`) is **provider-agnostic** — all three providers, no longer Xero-only:

- **Presence** — pages the last 90 days of Completed journalEntry ops and verifies each distinct externalId still exists remotely via `fetchRemoteJournalTotals` (`core/remote-journal.ts` — dispatches on the concrete provider class: Xero manual journals, Rillet journal entries, QBO journal entries; returns net debit-signed totals per remote account ref, `found: false` for missing/voided/deleted, never throws except `RatelimitError`). Drift entries land at `companyIntegration.metadata.settings.postingSync.lastReconciliation` (the SyncActivity banner's feed).
- **Tie-out** — writes one `accountingSyncTieOut` row per (integration × accountingPeriod × account) (migration `20260811223145`; single-column FK to `accountingPeriod` — its PK is `(id)` alone; RLS is SELECT-only under `accounting_view`, rows written by the cron via service role). Per cell: `carbonPostedAmount` split into `synced/docBacked/excluded/pending/blocked` by each journal's ledger disposition (least-delivered bucket wins across an op + its `:reversal` twin; `DOC_BACKED` counts as delivered only while the backing document really synced), `providerAmount` from the presence fetches (strictly reused, never fetched twice; NULL when uncovered), `internalDelta` (I1: carbonPosted − sum of buckets) and `externalDelta` (I5: synced − provider).
- **ERP surface** — `x+/accounting+/sync-tieout.tsx` (+ `$cellId` drawer drill-down), nav item under Accounting → Reports (`path.to.accountingSyncTieOut`); the SyncActivity tab gets a tie-out summary card + a Failed/Warning count badge. **Period close**: the "External GL sync complete" Blocker auto-check (`autoCheckKey: "external-gl-sync"`, seeded for new companies and reconciled for existing ones in the same migration) is computed by `getPeriodExternalGlSyncReadiness` (apps/erp `accounting.ee.service.ts`) — every journal posted into the period must carry a terminal disposition (Completed/Excluded/Skipped) for every active accounting integration; auto-passes only when NO active accounting integration exists (posting sync is always-on when one is connected).

## externalIntegrationMapping table

Source of external-ID truth (the old per-entity `externalId` JSONB columns were dropped). Migrations: `20260128140000_external-integration-mapping.sql` (CREATE), `20260130005853_external-id-migration.sql` (made `externalId` nullable + added back-compat views), `20260204001831_external-integration-mapping-rls.sql` (RLS).

Columns: `id` (PK, `id()`), `entityType`, `entityId` (Carbon internal ID), `integration` (e.g. `'xero'`, `'linear'`), `externalId` (nullable), `allowDuplicateExternalId BOOLEAN DEFAULT false`, `metadata JSONB`, `lastSyncedAt`, `remoteUpdatedAt`, `createdAt/updatedAt/createdBy`, `companyId`.

Constraints:
- `UNIQUE (entityType, entityId, integration, companyId)` — one mapping per integration per entity (the `link`/`linkBatch` upsert conflict target).
- Partial `UNIQUE (integration, externalId, entityType, companyId) WHERE allowDuplicateExternalId = false` — enforces external-ID uniqueness unless many-to-one is opted in.

Back-compat views reconstruct the legacy `externalId` JSONB via `jsonb_object_agg`: `suppliers`, `customers`, `parts`, `materials`, `tools`, `consumables`, `services`, `salesOrders` — so view-reading app code keeps working.

## Payment sync-back (inbound AR/AP) — the family-agnostic core

Provider payments (a customer invoice paid, or a **vendor bill paid**) flow back
into Carbon as `payment` + `invoiceSettlement` rows that close the
`salesInvoice`/`purchaseInvoice`. All three providers share one core:

- `core/payment-application.ts` — `NormalizedPayment` (`family: 'ar'|'ap'`,
  `documentRemoteId`, `paymentRemoteId`, amount/currency/date/reference, `status`,
  optional `linkedDocuments` for multi-doc fan-out) + `upsertLocalPaymentDraft`,
  which writes a **Draft** `payment` (AR→`Receipt`/`customerId`; AP→`Disbursement`/
  `supplierId`) + one `invoiceSettlement` per mapped document
  (`targetSalesInvoiceId`/`targetPurchaseInvoiceId`), idempotent by the `payment`
  mapping, dropping unmapped documents. Returns a `postAction` (`post`/`void`/`none`).
- `core/payment-syncer.ts` — `PaymentSyncerBase` (pull, plus the Phase G push below). Providers implement
  `mapToNormalized(remote, entityId)` + `fetchRemote`. The base overrides
  `pullFromAccounting`/`pullBatchFromAccounting`: Draft write in the base tx, then
  **after commit** invokes the native `post-payment` edge fn (`{type:'post'|'void'}`
  via a lazily-imported `getCarbonServiceRole()`), which builds the GL journal,
  sets `payment.journalId`, and derives document status. **Pulled payments DO post
  to Carbon's GL** — no double-count because `documents`-mode `Payment` journals are
  DOC_BACKED-excluded from outbound push (the payment journal never re-posts to the
  provider). `getSettledInvoiceStatus` is retained for tests only (status is
  view-derived). Provider-omitted rates remain `null` until authoritative company
  and currency reads confirm identity; foreign payments require a valid snapshot.
  Inbound payment amounts/source principal stay in document currency, while
  target principal is base. Outbound prior-credit-funded payments are rejected
  before provider writes because the existing provider cash endpoints cannot
  represent those allocations.
- Provider syncers: `providers/{rillet,quickbooks-online,xero}/entities/payment.ts`.
  Composite entity-id convention: AR = `<documentRemoteId>:<paymentRemoteId>` (no
  prefix, back-compat), AP = `bill:<billRemoteId>:<paymentRemoteId>`.
  Detection: Rillet AR = `/invoice-payments?updated.gt` (poll). Rillet AP has NO
  org-wide feed — `GET /bill-payments` does not exist (verified 404 on sandbox
  2026-08-13; the unguarded call used to kill every pull sweep), so
  `listBillPaymentsUpdatedSince` is composed: `GET /bills?updated.gt` (paying a
  bill bumps its `updated_at`) then `GET /bills/{id}/payments` per changed bill,
  each payment stamped with its bill's `updated_at`. QBO `Payment` +
  `BillPayment` (CDC + `webhook.quickbooks.$companyId.ts`); Xero `/Payments` via a
  new `listChanges` (`If-Modified-Since`) + Invoice-update webhook accelerator.
- Gate: `isPaymentSyncbackEnabled(metadata, family)` — pull-back only when the
  family is in `documents` mode (`PostingSyncSettings.families`); `journals`/`none`
  means Carbon owns the payment (v3 Phase 4 pushes it outbound). `shouldSync` also
  benignly skips a payment whose settled document has no local mapping (ownership).

### Outbound payment write-back (Phase G — Rillet, Xero, QBO)

Payments executed OUTSIDE the provider (e.g. a bill paid through Ramp, recorded
in Carbon, or a manual Carbon payment) push back so the provider's bill/invoice
closes. `PaymentSyncerBase` gained a bespoke `pushToAccounting` (not the templated
fetchLocal→mapToRemote flow): it reads the Carbon `payment` + `invoiceSettlement`
directly, gates on the SAME documents-mode families gate as pull, and routes
per-record by the `payment` mapping — a payment that already carries a mapping is
provider-known and skips (the loop guard: a pulled payment links its mapping
BEFORE post-payment flips it to Posted, so its Posted event finds the mapping and
skips). A mapping-less Carbon-born payment is pushed via the provider adapter
`pushRemotePayment` (one provider payment per settled document), then linked under
the composite id with `metadata.origin = "carbon"` so a later void echoes out and
a later pull no-ops. `supportsPaymentPush` gates the whole thing — **Rillet, Xero,
AND QBO all set it true** (2026-08-14 parity). The capability set
`PAYMENT_PUSH_PROVIDERS` (`core/payment-syncer.ts`, must stay in sync with the
syncer flags) is what the reconcile executor and outbound sweep read instead of the
old `providerId === "rillet"` literal. Push validation controls supported
currency, funding and discount shapes; unsupported payments park as Skipped.
Rillet supports native voids for Carbon-origin payments: every persisted mapping
under the payment's single/fan-out identity is deleted remotely, then marked
`metadata.voided=true` in one local transaction. Mapping identities survive;
404 means the desired deletion already happened, while provider refusals remain
visible failures. Pulled/provider-origin payments never echo deletion. The paid date goes
through `toPostingDateString` (Kysely's pg driver returns DATE columns as JS
`Date`s; a bare `.slice` crashed the push). Provider adapters (`pushRemotePayment`):
**Rillet** `createInvoicePayment`/`createBillPayment` (`POST /{invoices,bills}/{id}/payments`,
flat body `{ amount, date, account_code }` — `date`, NOT `payment_date`; bill path
VERIFIED sandbox 2026-08-11). **Xero** `createPayment` (`PUT /Payments`
`{ Payments:[{ Invoice:{InvoiceID}, Account:{Code}, Amount, Date }] }` —
**live-VERIFIED sandbox 2026-08-14**: bill flipped to PAID; the Account must be a
Xero `Type:"BANK"` account, and `EnablePaymentsToAccount` is NOT the gate for bank
accounts). **QBO** AP `createBillPayment` / AR `createPayment` via `writeEntity`
(payload VERIFY-flagged — no QBO sandbox; needs `VendorRef`/`CustomerRef` +
`PayType`/`BankAccountRef` (AP) or `DepositToAccountRef` (AR)). Trigger: the
`payment` table has an event trigger (`20260807152238_payment-event-trigger.sql`)
+ a `${provider}-sync` `payment` subscription from `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS`
convergence (now Rillet/Xero/QBO; no migration backfill — see the subscriptions
section); the reconciler enqueues push only on a transition to Posted/Voided. (Phase G design lived in the
removed v2 engine spec; the behavior is documented in this section — see git for history.)

## Document representation model (bills, invoices, items)

AR/AP **documents** preserve Carbon's component amounts and account effects.
Base-currency GL parity also requires the provider to accept Carbon's FX snapshot.
Rillet uses REVENUE_RECOGNITION_ONLY invoices with a fixed rate and same-day
recognition; AR_ONLY ignores the invoice rate and initially credits deferred
revenue, so it cannot mirror Carbon's posting. Spec:
`.ai/specs/implemented/2026-08-05-accounting-document-representation.md`.

- **AP bills = account-costed replay of the posted "Purchase Invoice" journal**,
  NOT the item's account. `core/document-costing.ts` is the shared core:
  `loadBillCostingLines(db, { companyId, billId })` reads the
  posted journal (`journal.sourceType='Purchase Invoice'`, `status='Posted'`),
  excludes original AP/IC control rows using `classifyAccountingPostingRole` from
  `@carbon/utils` (never today's payables default), and returns base-currency debit-signed
  `CostingLine[]` (+ `currencyCode`/`exchangeRate`, document total, base currency and precision). Item labels are joined via
  `journalLine.documentLineReference` (`purchase-invoice:<purchaseOrderLineId>`
  → `purchaseOrderLine.itemId` → `item`); direct no-PO / variance lines have
  `sourceItem: undefined`. `toTransactionCurrencyLines(lines, {exchangeRate, documentTotal, decimalPlaces})`
  multiplies base values by the foreign-per-base rate, rounds at document
  currency precision, and reconciles only a permitted rounding residual to the
  largest absolute line; its storage envelope derives from shared `SCALE`.
  Identity conversion also rounds; signed PPV is retained. The item is a **description
  label only** (`costingLineItemLabel`). Bill lines are **tax-neutral** (the
  purchase posting folds tax into cost): Rillet no `tax_rate`, QBO no
  `TxnTaxDetail`, Xero `TaxType: "NONE"`. FX bills pin the provider rate
  (Rillet named `exchange_rate` object, QBO `CurrencyRef` + reciprocal
  `ExchangeRate = 1/r`, Xero `CurrencyRate = r`, including foreign 1:1 snapshots).
  Rillet's directed pair is document currency → subsidiary base currency at
  `1/r`, not Carbon's base → document convention. Foreign1:1 must stay explicit.
  This direction is verified against the sandbox's independent journal report.
  Every bill syncer has a posted-status `shouldSync` (Draft excluded — no
  journal to replay). Missing original journal/control/account metadata throws
  the structured `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` Warning before numeric reconciliation.
  A genuine costing amount discrepancy remains a failure. Provider builders
  accept costing-only rows and do not repeat the AP filter.
  - QBO bill emits `AccountBasedExpenseLineDetail` from a NEW bill-only builder
    (`buildQboBillLines`); it no longer uses the shared `buildQboExpenseLines`
    or `ensureDependencySynced("item")`. Xero bill uses `buildXeroBillLineItems`.
    Rillet bill (`mapBillToRilletBill`) is the reference (prepends the label;
    QBO/Xero substitute it). Account codes resolve through the shared
    `loadAccountCodesById` (Xero) / `loadQboAccountRefsById` (QBO) /
    `loadRilletAccountCodesById` (Rillet).
- **AR invoices preserve separate sales, shipping and native tax components.**
  `core/sales-invoice-source.ts` is the single typed batch loader for all three
  invoice adapters: authoritative view totals, add-ons, line/header shipping,
  group-scoped currency metadata and the original posted Shipping Revenue
  account. `core/sales-document-components.ts` shares the internal posting
  breakdown, converts base amounts once and reconciles document rounding
  through `distributeRoundingResidual` (`@carbon/utils`) — **largest remainder,
  one minor unit per component**, ordered by component id so an exact tie
  resolves the same way whatever order the lines arrive in. Do NOT go back to
  concentrating the residual on a single component: that breaks the component's
  own percent/amount pair, and QBO's `tax = net × percent` preflight
  (`invoice-tax.ts`) then refuses the invoice with a message blaming the
  customer's tax configuration, which they cannot act on. A component's unit
  price is DERIVED from its reconciled net when the stored `convertedUnitPrice`
  mirror and the converted extension straddle a rounding tie (the two are
  rounded on independent float paths); it still refuses when no representable
  price can reproduce the net, which is a real quantity/total contradiction.
  Original journal reads scope company, document, source type and Posted
  status; the shared role selector excludes VOID descriptions. Missing or
  ambiguous original shipping accounts refuse sync before dependency writes.
  Changing defaults after posting cannot change the account used on retry.
  Merchandise and add-ons retain the item's existing sales mapping. QBO and
  Rillet provision reusable service/product helpers under `shippingItem`, keyed
  by the original shipping account (Rillet also includes base currency).
  Tax appears once through native provider fields; COGS stays on the pushed
  `Sales Shipment` journal.
  - Xero sends one monetary unit per component, keeping original quantity and
    unit price in Description. This preserves net and native tax for bulk
    quantities and fine unit prices. Actual invoice/bill POSTs use `unitdp=4`;
    amounts that cannot be represented at Xero's two-decimal monetary boundary
    are refused before document writes rather than rounded away. Tax magnitude
    cannot exceed the monetary line unit; exotic/negative taxable adjustments
    still need provider acceptance. [Xero rounding contract](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/how-to-guides/rounding-in-xero/).
    CurrencyRate is omitted only for identical currencies; foreign 1:1 stays
    explicit. Preflight and mocked transports do not prove returned-provider
    totals; connected acceptance must compare those independently.
  - QBO US line `TAX`/`NON` values are documented protocol markers, so an
    untaxed US invoice does not require catalog marker rows. Nonzero US
    transaction tax rates and all non-US line codes still resolve from the
    real active catalog; missing/ambiguous configuration raises
    `UNMAPPED_TAX_CODES` before dependencies. Failed catalog reads evict the
    cached promise so another invoice can retry. [Intuit SDK tax contract](https://intuit.github.io/QuickBooks-V3-PHP-SDK/quickstart.html#constructing-entities-with-tax).
  - Rillet REVENUE_RECOGNITION_ONLY accepts the same directed fixed rate as bills.
    Each item has a DAILY revenue period beginning and ending on Carbon's
    posting date, also used as the remote invoice/FX date. The interim
    deferred-revenue entries net to zero and recognition
    credits the mapped revenue account; shipping retains its original-account
    override. Native invoice/bill DELETE handles Carbon Voided status before
    the mapped-create idempotency shortcut. Reconciliation and the outbound
    sweep include mapped voided documents/payments, and mapping tombstones stop
    repeated deletes. Compare independent remote GL, including recognition
    and reversal, instead of treating create HTTP200 as accounting parity.
- **Provider items are non-tracked** so the provider never posts inventory
  (bills) or COGS (invoices): Xero pushes `IsTrackedAsInventory: false` on
  create and OMITS the flag on update (Xero rejects untracking an item with
  stock/txns; a still-tracked remote logs a recorded warning to untrack
  manually). QBO items are Service/NonInventory (never Inventory).
- **PO / SO / Quote are unchanged** — item-referenced, no GL constraint (QBO PO
  keeps `buildQboExpenseLines` / `ItemBasedExpenseLineDetail`).

## Dimensions (journal / bill analytics)

Journal-entry and bill line dimensions (`journalLineDimension`) map to provider
analytics fields. **Rillet sends ALL dimensions on every line and auto-provisions
what's missing** — there is no per-company slot/cap (Rillet Fields are unlimited).
`RilletTransactionSyncer.resolveLineDimensions(lines)` (`providers/rillet/entities/shared.ts`)
resolves each distinct dimension to a Rillet Field id (reuse an existing Field by
name, else `createField(name, "EXPENSES")` — journal entries + bills are
expense-side) and each value to a Field-value id (`upsertFieldValue` by the
value's readable label), persisting both in `externalIntegrationMapping`
(`entityType` `"dimension"` for the Field via `upsertDimensionMapping`,
`"dimensionValue"` for the value). The Rillet mappers iterate `line.dimensions`;
a dimension whose Field or value can't be provisioned is dropped from that line's
refs. `createField` (`POST /fields`) is VERIFY-flagged — confirm the payload on
the Rillet sandbox.

**Xero/QBO keep the slot system** (`dimensionSlots` + `maxJournalDimensionSlots`
= 2 each; `validateDimensionSlots`, the Dimensions settings tab). For Rillet the
slot config is now inert (the mapper no longer reads it) — the tab's slot editor
is dead config for Rillet only, left in place for the capped providers.

## Gotchas

- All DB writes during sync are wrapped in `withTriggersDisabled(database, tx => ...)` to break the loop (sync writes DB → event trigger → sync again). Since migration `20260811224732`, that suppression is **scoped**: `dispatch_event_batch()` drops only SYNC/WEBHOOK/WORKFLOW subscriptions while `app.sync_in_progress` is set (the loop/echo-prone types); SEARCH/AUDIT/EMBEDDING observers now see sync-written rows (v4 F13). **Exception:** payment sync-back invokes `post-payment` *outside* that tx (triggers enabled), like a user posting a payment — intended.
- Rillet create POSTs carry a deterministic, **entity-scoped** `Idempotency-Key`: `buildRilletIdempotencyKey` (`providers/rillet/provider.ts`) = sha256 of `companyId:operation:localId`; Rillet replays the stored response for 24h. The payload is deliberately **NOT hashed** (v4 Pillar C): a crash between the remote create and the local mapping write retries with a possibly-drifted payload, and a payload-sensitive key would mint a fresh key and duplicate the remote document. Contract pinned by `providers/rillet/__tests__/provider.test.ts`.
- The event-queue drainer (`events/queue.ts`) archives unknown-`handlerType` messages to pgmq's dead-letter table (`pgmq.a_event_system`) instead of crash-looping the whole drain (v4 F8) — a poison message can no longer wedge ALL event processing.
- `ContactSyncer.getRemoteId` checks both `customer` and `vendor` mappings (one Xero Contact backs both).
- Transaction syncers (PO, invoice, bill) use `ensureDependencySynced(type, localId)` for JIT dependency syncing (e.g. push the customer before its invoice); `dependsOn` is declared in `ENTITY_DEFINITIONS`.
- DELETE sync is not implemented anywhere yet.
- Don't hand-edit generated DB types; read the newest migration for schema truth.
