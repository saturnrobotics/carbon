# Authentication System

Carbon auth is built on Supabase Auth with cookie sessions, Redis-cached claims, and
per-company role/permission gating enforced through Postgres RLS. The `@carbon/auth`
package is the single source of truth; ERP and MES consume it.

## Package: `@carbon/auth` (`packages/auth/src`)

Export subpaths (`package.json`): `.` (`index.ts`), `./auth.server`, `./session.server`,
`./company.server`, `./users.server`, `./passkey.server`, `./verification.server`,
`./middleware/flash.{server,client}`. User query helpers split across
`services/users.ts` (client-safe: `getClaims`, `getPermissionCacheKey`,
`getCompaniesForUser`, `makePermissionsFromClaims`) and `services/users.server.ts`
(server-only: `getUserClaims`, deactivate flows).

## Supabase client factories (`lib/supabase/client.ts`, `client.server.ts`)

- `getCarbon(accessToken?)` — anon-key client, optionally Bearer-authed as a user.
- `getCarbonServiceRole()` — service-role client, bypasses RLS (admin ops only).
- `getCarbonAPIKeyClient(apiKey)` — anon client that sends the `carbon-key` header so
  RLS resolves the company via the key.
- `getUserScopedClient(userId)` — mints a short-lived (5m) HS256 JWT with
  `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` and returns a user-scoped client (RLS enforced).
- All clients use `fetchWithRetry` (timeout + retry on 5xx/408/524).

## Login (`apps/erp/app/routes/_public+/login.tsx`)

Magic link is the primary flow. The action rate-limits by IP (Upstash via `@carbon/kv`,
`RATE_LIMIT` env default **5 / hour**), runs the bot check (`verifyBotProtection`), then:

**Bot protection.** `botProtection` (`bot-protection.server.ts`, re-exported from
`auth.server.ts`) picks ONE provider per process from `BOT_PROTECTION`: `"botid"` (only
ON Vercel — `IS_VERCEL`, from Vercel's own `VERCEL=1`, which SST/Docker/the BYOC chart
never set) or `"turnstile"` (needs both `CLOUDFLARE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and
`_SECRET_KEY`). Unset: BotID for Cloud on Vercel, else Turnstile when both keys are set,
else `null` (no check). It is explicit because the Turnstile keys can be present for
something else (GoTrue, another form) while login uses BotID. An explicit value that
cannot work (botid off Vercel, turnstile without keys, anything else) throws at boot.
Every login loader (erp, mes, academy, starter) returns it, and the page calls
`useBotProtection("/login", botProtection)` (`@carbon/react`), which returns
`{ token, ready, challenge }`: render `challenge` in the form, post `token` as the hidden
`botToken`, and disable submit until `ready`. For BotID the hook runs `initBotId`, which
patches `window.fetch` so a POST to `/login` or `/login.data` carries the invisible
challenge, and `challenge` is null. For Turnstile it renders the widget and `ready` waits
on its token. The action calls `verifyBotProtection({ token: botToken, ip, actor })`.
Both sides read the one value on purpose: off Vercel the BotID script (served through the
`apps/*/vercel.json` rewrites) 404s and the patched fetch rejects, so the client must
never init BotID where the server cannot verify it. Failure modes differ deliberately: a
`checkBotId` THROW fails OPEN and logs (a platform misconfiguration would otherwise lock
out every Cloud user), while an unreachable Turnstile siteverify fails CLOSED (an operator
chose Turnstile by setting its keys). The rate limit and lockout apply either way.
Turnstile is verified in-app only; Supabase Auth captcha (Attack Protection) must stay OFF,
because the magic-link call forwards no token to GoTrue.
- Unknown user (non-Enterprise) → `sendVerificationCode`, redirect to `/verify` (email
  verification-code signup). Enterprise edition rejects unknown users.

**Self-signup blocklist (Cloud edition only)** — `isSelfSignupBlockedForEmail` /
`SELF_SIGNUP_BLOCKED_MESSAGE` in `@carbon/auth/self-signup.server` (the domain list is
the bundled `self-signup-blocked-domains.txt`, loaded via `?raw`). A brand-new
self-signup on a free/disposable email domain is refused. The email path checks
before the account exists — `login.tsx` (unknown-user branch) and `verify.tsx`
(before `createEmailAuthAccount`). OAuth (Google/Azure) has **no** pre-create seam:
GoTrue and the `create_public_user` trigger provision the user during the handshake,
so both apps' `callback.tsx` refuse a blocked-domain **self-signup** (no company
membership AND no pending `invite`) in the non-SSO branch and decline to mint a
session — the inert, membership-less account is left as-is (a later legitimate invite
reuses the row via `createEmployeeAccount`), so there is no teardown. Existing members
and invited contractors are never affected. No-op outside Cloud edition.

Other methods on the login page: Google + Azure OAuth (`signInWithOAuth`, redirect to
`/callback`), Passkey/WebAuthn (`@simplewebauthn`, `/api/passkey/authenticate/*`,
backed by `passkey.server.ts`), and — Enterprise edition with `sso` in
`AUTH_PROVIDERS` — SAML SSO ("Continue with SSO" → `api+/sso.check.ts` →
`signInWithSSO` → IdP → `/callback`; see the SSO section below). Availability
gated by `isAuthProviderEnabled(...)`.
<!-- UNVERIFIED: there is no /signup route; the old cache doc's "/signup" + "Sign up for free" claims were stale (and contained a git merge-conflict artifact). Signup happens via the verification-code flow above. -->

Routes live under `_public+/` (`login`, `callback`, `logout`, `magic-link`, `verify`,
`invite.$code`, `refresh-session`). MES mirrors a subset under its own `_public+/`.

## Enterprise SAML SSO (`@carbon/ee/sso.server` + `ssoConnection`)

Self-hosted-only (direct `auth.identities` writes). The whole feature lives in
`packages/ee/src/sso/` behind **`isSsoEnabled()`** (`gate.ts`): Enterprise
edition AND `sso` in `AUTH_PROVIDERS`. The connection lookups and admin
mutations SELF-GATE on it (they answer "no connection" / refuse without
querying), and every route entry point checks it too — login buttons, the
`sso.check` endpoints, the settings action, and the callbacks' SSO branch
(which then also skips the `admin.getUserById` call). `@carbon/auth` keeps only
`AuthSession.ssoProviderId` + its preservation across refresh. Design record:
`.ai/specs/2026-08-21-enterprise-saml-sso.md`.

- **Provider management**: `packages/ee/src/sso/provider.server.ts` wraps the GoTrue
  admin SSO API (`create/update/delete/getGoTrueSsoProvider`, service-role key).
  `getSamlSpUrls()` returns the UN-prefixed `/sso/saml/{acs,metadata}` URLs — GoTrue
  self-declares its SP entityID/ACS from `API_EXTERNAL_URL` without `/auth/v1` and
  validates each assertion's `Destination` against that exact URL; Kong routes `/sso/`
  (`kong.yml` `auth-v1-sso`). Admin UX: Settings → Security (`x+/settings+/security.tsx`,
  action `x+/settings+/sso.tsx`) via `upsertSsoConnection` / `updateSsoRequireSso` /
  `deactivateSsoConnection` in `connections.server.ts`.
- **`ssoConnection` table** (migration `20260820215433`; partial unique index also
  in `20260825185617` for pre-squash DBs) binds a provider to a company:
  `providerId` UNIQUE, `metadataUrl` XOR `metadataXml` (CHECK),
  `active`, `requireSso`, and at most ONE active row per company
  (`ssoConnection_companyId_active_key` — readers use `.maybeSingle()`). GoTrue
  providers are project-global, so the CALLBACK — not GoTrue — enforces
  provider → company + email-domain binding.
- **Domain ownership verification** (`ssoDomain` table, same migration; spec
  `.ai/specs/2026-08-27-sso-domain-verification.md`): one row per claimed email
  domain — `verificationToken` (32-hex, per row), `status pending|verified`.
  Exclusivity attaches to VERIFICATION, not the claim: `UNIQUE("companyId","domain")`
  plus a partial unique index on `("domain") WHERE status='verified'` — any number
  of companies may hold pending claims on one domain (a free pending row must not
  block the rightful owner — that would be a squatting vector); first to verify
  wins, race-free. A cross-company verify conflict fails fast with a deliberately
  GENERIC message ("Failed to verify domain") — a distinct one would be an oracle
  for probing which domains are verified where. `addSsoDomain` pre-checks the
  company's own duplicate (no error-code branching). A domain
  routes SSO / enforces `requireSso` only while VERIFIED; the connection lookups
  in `connections.server.ts` attach a computed `domains: string[]` of verified
  domains, so consumers (callbacks, invite guards) keep the old shape. The DNS
  challenge (`verification.server.ts`): TXT at `_carbon-challenge.<domain>` with
  `carbon-domain-verification=<token>`, checked manually via the Verify button
  (pinned resolvers 1.1.1.1/8.8.8.8; no polling, no re-verification — one-shot
  by design). Only verified domains are pushed to the GoTrue provider
  (`syncGoTrueDomains`); a new connection registers with `domains: []`.
  Domain admin flows: `addSsoDomain` / `verifySsoDomain` / `removeSsoDomain`
  intents on `x+/settings+/sso.tsx`; UI is the Email Domains card on
  Settings → Security. Deactivating a connection DELETES its `ssoDomain` rows
  (releases the claims; re-activation re-verifies). Public email providers are
  denied at validation (`PUBLIC_EMAIL_DOMAINS`, `settings.models.ts`).
- **Session classification**: `getSsoProviderIdFromSession(accessToken, user)` requires
  an `amr` entry with `method: "sso/saml"` before resolving the provider id; fails
  CLOSED to the non-SSO path. `getSsoProviderIdFromUser` only answers "HAS an SSO
  identity" — a linked account's Google/magic-link login also satisfies it; never use
  it to classify a session. `AuthSession.ssoProviderId` is stamped at the callback and
  preserved across refresh and company switch.
- **Callback SSO branch** (ERP `_public+/callback.tsx`): verifies connection + domain;
  an ACTIVE same-email account gets the SAML identity LINKED onto it
  (`linkSsoIdentityToUser` — also deletes stale `sso:%` identities on the target, then
  the duplicate auth user is deleted and a session minted via server-side magic-link
  redemption); otherwise the invite-first migration `migrateUserToSso` runs (one Kysely
  transaction: user row, role-keyed account activation — `employee` /
  `customerAccount` / `supplierAccount` — membership, permission merge, invite accept
  under FOR UPDATE). No invite (and the domain-mismatch rejection) → rejected;
  `deleteJitSsoUser` removes the WHOLE throwaway JIT user — auth user plus the
  trigger-created `user`/`userPermission` rows (no FK cascade between the schemas),
  guarded on zero memberships — or the leftover profile trips `authIdentityExists`
  and makes the email un-invitable. MES defers first login to ERP.
- **Pre-seeded account linking** (`provisioning.server.ts`; spec
  `.ai/specs/2026-08-29-saml-sso-account-linking.md`): Carbon runs GoTrue with
  `GOTRUE_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true`, so a SAML sign-in that GoTrue classifies as
  "create a new user" is rejected (422) — the callback link above only fires once
  a user *already* has an identity to match. The fix is to pre-seed a row in
  `auth.identities` for the existing user so GoTrue takes its LinkAccount /
  AccountExists branch instead. **Provider-agnostic**: the match is carried by the
  GENERATED `email` column (`identity_data.email = lower(email)`), NOT
  `provider_id` — GoTrue marks every SAML assertion email Verified and falls back
  to email-column matching for EVERY successful SAML login, so it works for any
  IdP regardless of NameID shape (Okta email vs Entra opaque pairwise id). GoTrue
  self-heals a second row keyed on the real NameID on first login; both are torn
  down together. Three raw-`sql` writers (pinned by `sso.server.test.ts` via a
  capturing Kysely driver): `seedSsoIdentityForUser` (one user, idempotent
  `ON CONFLICT (provider_id, provider) DO NOTHING`) — called best-effort/logged by
  `seedSsoIdentityForNewUser` in all three ERP account-creation flows
  (`users.server.ts` create{Customer,Employee,Supplier}Account); and, run from the
  domain-claim flows, `backfillSsoIdentitiesForDomain` (verify → seed EVERY
  existing non-SSO user on the domain) and `removeSsoIdentitiesForDomain` (unregister
  → delete, keyed on the email column so it also removes GoTrue's self-healed
  NameID rows). Backfill/remove are deliberately **not** `companyId`-scoped: the
  adopted policy is that the verified domain owner controls identity for that
  domain instance-wide (GoTrue keys SSO on domain, not company), which the
  cross-company verified-domain exclusivity index makes safe. Pure helpers
  `emailDomain` / `ssoProviderColumn`. A DB guard — `enforce_sso_domain_claim`
  trigger on `auth.sso_domains` + the `ssoReservedDomain` table (migration
  `20260829142619_sso-domain-guard.sql`) — refuses any `auth.sso_domains` insert
  for a reserved domain or one with no Carbon-side `ssoDomain` claim, so a domain
  cannot be registered (and thus control identity) without going through
  verification.
- **Require SSO** (`ssoConnection.requireSso`): `isSsoRequiredForEmail`
  (`connections.server.ts`, like all connection lookups —
  `getSsoConnectionByDomain` / `getSsoConnectionByProviderId` are the ONE copy
  shared by ERP, MES, and jobs) refuses non-SSO logins server-side at the login
  actions, the callbacks' non-SSO branch, and the passkey verify routes in both
  apps. `DEV_BYPASS_EMAIL` is exempt. Break-glass:
  `UPDATE "ssoConnection" SET "requireSso" = false WHERE "companyId" = '<id>';`.
- **MFA**: SSO sessions mint `mfaVerified: true` unconditionally (including
  `CONTROLLED_ENVIRONMENT`) and the `requireMfa` enrollment gate exempts them — the
  IdP owns MFA (user decision).
- **Trigger**: `create_public_user()` SKIPS (inserts nothing) when the new auth user's
  email already belongs to a DIFFERENT `public."user"` row — the callback migration
  owns that case; inserting would FK/unique-crash GoTrue's signup transaction.
- **Invites**: `getSsoAwareInviteLink` (`connections.server.ts`; used by the ERP
  invite routes and jobs `user-admin.ts`) routes covered-domain invite emails to
  `/login?email=...` instead of `/invite/<code>`, so the IdP is never bypassed.
  Employee invites outside the covered domains are refused up front
  (`getSsoInviteDomainError` in ERP `users.server.ts` → `uncoveredSsoDomainError`).
- **Config**: GoTrue SAML via `SAML_ENABLED` / `SAML_PRIVATE_KEY` in root `.env`
  (compose substitution → `GOTRUE_SAML_*`; `crbn reload` does not read root `.env` —
  see `.ai/lessons.md`).

## Sessions (`session.server.ts`)

- `createCookieSessionStorage`, cookie name **`carbon`**, `httpOnly`, `sameSite: "lax"`
  (`"none"` in Test edition), `secure`/`domain` from `DOMAIN` in non-test. Payload stored
  under key `SESSION_KEY = "auth"`; `SESSION_MAX_AGE = 7 days`.
- `requireAuthSession` reads/validates; `getOrRefreshAuthSession` refreshes within
  `REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` (10 min) of expiry via `refreshAccessToken`.
- `destroyAuthSession` clears auth + company-id cookies, redirects to login.
  `updateCompanySession` / `updateSessionConsole` switch active company / console mode.

## MFA / TOTP (`mfa.server.ts`)

Supabase TOTP MFA, gated explicitly in app code (server-side sign-in runs through the
service role, so GoTrue's automatic AAL enforcement never fires). Factors live in
Supabase's `auth.mfa_factors` — no app table.

- **Gate at login**: ERP/MES `callback.tsx` and `passkey.authenticate.verify.ts` check
  `userHasVerifiedTotpFactor(userId)` after the first factor succeeds; enrolled users get
  their tokens parked via `setPendingMfaSession` (session key `"mfa"`, 10-min TTL) and a
  redirect to `/mfa` — the full `carbon` cookie is only minted after the challenge.
- **Active re-check**: `requireAuthSession` bounces any session without
  `AuthSession.mfaVerified` whose user has a verified factor to `/mfa` (covers sessions
  minted before enrollment). The factor lookup is Redis-cached (`mfa:factors:${userId}`,
  1h TTL, invalidated on enroll/unenroll/admin reset) and `oncePerRead`-memoized; it
  fails OPEN on lookup errors. Dev-bypass sessions are minted with `mfaVerified: true`.
- **`/mfa` routes** exist in all four apps (ERP/MES/starter `_public+/mfa.tsx`, academy
  `_auth+/mfa.tsx`); the shared action logic is `completeMfaChallenge(request, code)` in
  `session.server.ts`. Academy/starter have no callback gate — the re-check bounces them.
- **Token rotation**: every `challengeAndVerify` rotates the refresh token — any caller
  MUST re-issue the cookie from the returned session (`/mfa` routes, `api+/mfa.verify`,
  `api+/mfa.unenroll` all do). `refreshAuthSession` preserves `mfaVerified` like `console`.
- **auth-js gotcha**: `supabase.auth.mfa.*` reads the client's INTERNAL session, not the
  `Authorization` header override — `mfa.server.ts` seeds a fresh anon client via
  `auth.setSession` with the cookie's tokens.
- **Enrollment**: Account → Security (`x+/account+/security.tsx`, which also owns
  passkeys) → `api+/mfa.enroll` / `mfa.verify` / `mfa.unenroll` (unenroll requires a
  current code as step-up). The enroll→scan→verify state machine, the 6-slot code
  input, and the invalid-code copy are shared with the enforcement gate via
  `~/components/TotpEnrollment` (`useTotpEnrollment`, `OtpInput`,
  `INVALID_CODE_MESSAGE`) — change them there, not per surface. The QR carries
  `issuer` = `Carbon (<company name>)` so a phone can tell two Carbon tenants
  apart (the account line is the user's email, set by GoTrue). `sanitizeIssuer`
  strips colons: `otpauth://totp/{issuer}:{account}` uses one as its delimiter
  and the Key-URI spec forbids it in either field. The issuer is baked into the
  QR at enrollment — changing it does not update existing entries. Admin recovery:
  `x+/users+/employees.reset-mfa.$employeeId.tsx` (`update: "users"`) calls
  `adminDeleteTotpFactors` — factors are global to the auth user, so it affects
  every company the user belongs to.
- **Org enforcement**: `companySettings.requireMfa` (migration
  `20260816103045`) toggled from Settings → System → Security
  (`x+/settings+/security.tsx`); `CONTROLLED_ENVIRONMENT=true`
  forces it on and cannot be overridden (NIST 800-171 3.5.3). Enforced as a
  BLOCKING SCREEN in the ERP/MES shell loaders (`MfaEnrollmentRequired`), never a
  redirect — a redirect would have to allowlist the `api+/mfa.*` routes used to
  escape it, and any gap there is a lockout or a hole. Mirrors the ITAR gate.
  Scoped to the ACTIVE company only: a user in a company that does not require
  MFA is not gated, and the shell re-runs on company switch. Console sessions are
  exempt (a shared kiosk cannot complete a personal enrollment); SSO sessions
  (`authSession.ssoProviderId` set) are exempt too, including under
  `CONTROLLED_ENVIRONMENT` — the IdP owns MFA (see the SSO section); MES has no
  enrollment UI so its gate links to ERP.
- **Email**: `~/services/mfa-email.server.ts` owns both MFA emails
  (`MfaRequiredEmail` / `MfaEnabledEmail` in `@carbon/documents/email`).
  `sendMfaRequiredEmails` fires from the settings action on the **off → on
  transition only** (it re-reads `companySettings.requireMfa` first — the Switch
  re-submits on every flip), and batches active employees through
  `batchTrigger("send-email", …)` 25 at a time. It is additionally skipped when
  `CONTROLLED_ENVIRONMENT` — effective enforcement there is
  `CONTROLLED_ENVIRONMENT || requireMfa` and NOTHING ever writes the column, so
  it sits `false` while MFA is already mandatory; the column alone would read as
  a fresh transition and announce a requirement that predates the deployment.
  The Switch is `disabled` in that mode, but the action has no such guard, so
  this cannot live in the UI. `sendMfaEnabledEmail` fires from
  `api+/mfa.verify` — that route only ever verifies an ENROLLMENT (a login
  challenge goes through `completeMfaChallenge` on `/mfa`), so reaching it means
  a factor was just added. Both take a service-role client, and NEITHER goes
  through `trigger("notify", …)`: security mail must not be silenced by a
  `notificationPreference` opt-out or gated on the `EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS` plan
  feature. Both swallow their own errors — enrollment and the setting flip must
  not fail because email did.
- **Admin visibility**: the `users_with_verified_mfa(company_id)` RPC
  (SECURITY DEFINER — `auth.mfa_factors` is unreachable from the SECURITY_INVOKER
  `employees` view) backs the Two-Factor column on employee accounts. It returns
  ids only, is scoped to the caller's companies, and returns nothing unless the
  company enforces MFA. **A migration that adds an RPC needs a PostgREST schema
  reload** or the function is invisible to the app.
- **Config**: local GoTrue MFA env in `packages/dev/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`
  (`GOTRUE_MFA_TOTP_*`); `[auth.mfa]` in `config.toml` for hosted parity. API-key and
  OAuth/MCP token auth are machine paths and are not challenged.

## Permissions & RLS gating (`auth.server.ts` → `requirePermissions`)

`requirePermissions(request, { view?, create?, update?, delete?, role?, bypassRls? })` is
the gate used in every loader/action. Two paths:

1. **`carbon-key` header present** → API-key auth (see below).
2. **Otherwise** → `requireAuthSession`, then `getUserClaims(userId, companyId)`.
   - Claims are `{ role, permissions }`. Cached in **Redis** (`@carbon/kv`) at key
     `permissions:${userId}`; on miss, fetched via the `get_claims(uid, company)` RPC
     (`getCarbonServiceRole`) and cached. `makePermissionsFromClaims` shapes the result.
   - `getUserClaims` is additionally memoized **per read request** via
     `oncePerRead` (`@carbon/logger/middleware.server`), so the several loaders a
     page matches share one Redis GET. Read-gated on purpose: an action and its
     loader revalidation run in the same request, and memoizing there could let a
     gate pass on claims the action just revoked. The Supabase clients
     `requirePermissions` returns are memoized per request too (`oncePerRequest`),
     which needs no gate — a client is not database state.
   - Each required permission checks `permissions[name][action]` contains the active
     `companyId` (or `"0"` wildcard = all companies). `role` is matched directly.
   - On failure: if `role === null` destroy session → `/`; else flash "Access Denied"
     → authenticated root.
   - Returns `{ client, companyId, companyGroupId, email, userId, sessionUserId,
     consoleMode }`. `bypassRls: true` + employee role returns a service-role client;
     otherwise a Bearer-authed `getCarbon(accessToken)` client (RLS enforced).

Claims cache must be invalidated when permissions change — `users.server.ts` deactivate
flows call `redis.del(getPermissionCacheKey(userId))`.

## API key auth

`carbon-key: <key>` header. `requirePermissions` resolves it through
`getCompanyIdFromAPIKey`, which now reads via `getApiKeyRecord`
(`packages/auth/src/services/api-key.server.ts`): a **30s Redis cache** at
`apikey:auth:<keyHash>`, per-request memoized (`oncePerRequest`) so one HTTP call
does one lookup even though both `requirePermissions` and the v1 scope read need
the row. Unknown keys are cached too (the literal `"null"`), so a bad key
hammering the endpoint doesn't hammer Postgres. Redis being down falls through to
the DB. Busting: the api-keys settings routes call `invalidateApiKeyCache`
(`~/modules/settings/settings.server.ts` → `bustApiKeyCache`) after an edit and
BEFORE a delete (the keyHash is unreadable once the row is gone), so a scope
change or revocation takes effect immediately; the worst-case lag for any other
writer is the 30s TTL. Then:

- Reject if `expiresAt` passed (401).
- Rate-limit via `checkApiKeyRateLimit` (`@carbon/database/ratelimit`, Postgres function
  `check_api_key_rate_limit`) using per-key `rateLimit` + `rateLimitWindow`
  (`"1m"|"1h"|"1d"`). 429 with `X-RateLimit-*` + `Retry-After` headers on exceed.
- Fire-and-forget `lastUsedAt` update.
- Scope check: `scopes` is JSONB `{ "<permission>_<action>": [companyIds] }`; required
  perms must be present and include the active company. `{}` is NOT full access here —
  an empty scope set fails the check. 403 on failure.
- Cloud edition: Starter-plan companies are blocked from API access (Business+ only),
  except `STRIPE_BYPASS_COMPANY_IDS`.
- Returns a `getCarbonAPIKeyClient(apiKey)` client (RLS resolves company via header).

Key hashing: `hashApiKey` = `createHash("sha256")` hex (same in Node ERP and Deno edge
functions). Raw key is shown once; only `keyHash` is stored.

## OAuth 2.0 server (MCP remote connector)

ERP exposes an OAuth 2.0 AS for use as a remote Claude/MCP connector. Routes under
`_oauth+/` (`authorize.tsx`, `token.tsx`, `register.ts`) plus discovery at
`[.]well-known.oauth-authorization-server.ts` and `[.]well-known.oauth-protected-resource.ts`.

- PKCE supported (`code_challenge` / `code_challenge_method` S256|plain on authorize,
  `code_verifier` on token).
- Dynamic client registration (`POST /oauth/register`) writes to the **`oauthClient`**
  table. <!-- UNVERIFIED: the old cache doc described a separate `oauthDynamicClient` table; it does not exist in current migrations. -->
- Tables: `oauthClient`, `oauthCode`, `oauthToken` (all PK `xid()`, scoped by
  `companyId`/`userId`). Columns are plain TEXT, but **access tokens, refresh tokens, and
  client secrets are SHA-256 hashed at the app layer before storage** via
  `hashOAuthSecret` (`auth.server.ts`). Lookups hash the incoming value and compare.
- MCP endpoint (`apps/erp/app/routes/api+/mcp+/_index.ts`): a `Bearer` token (when no
  `carbon-key`) is hashed and looked up in `oauthToken`; on miss it falls back to
  `carbon-key` API-key auth. `companyId`/`userId` always come from the token context.

## Schema (newest migrations; `packages/database/supabase/migrations`)

- `user` / `userPermission` (`id`, `permissions` JSONB) — seeded by the
  `create_public_user()` trigger (`on_auth_user_created` on `auth.users`) — which
  SKIPS inserting when the email already belongs to a different `user` row (the
  SSO duplicate case; the callback migration owns it).
- `userToCompany` — junction, PK `(userId, companyId)`, `role` enum
  `'employee' | 'supplier' | 'customer'`.
- `ssoConnection` — SAML SSO tenant binding (see the SSO section): PK
  `(id, companyId)`, `providerId` UNIQUE,
  `metadataUrl`/`metadataXml` (exactly one, CHECK), `active`, `requireSso`.
  SELECT: employee role; writes: `settings_update`.
- `ssoDomain` — DNS-verified email domain claims: PK `(id, companyId)`,
  composite FK → `ssoConnection`, `UNIQUE("companyId","domain")` + partial unique
  `("domain") WHERE status='verified'` (first-to-verify-wins), `verificationToken`,
  `status` (`ssoDomainStatus` enum: `pending|verified`), `verifiedAt`. Same RLS split as
  `ssoConnection`.
- `apiKey` — `keyHash` (unique), `keyPreview`, `name`, `companyId`, `createdBy`, `scopes`
  JSONB, `rateLimit` (default **60**), `rateLimitWindow` (default `'1m'`), `expiresAt`,
  `lastUsedAt`. The old plaintext `key` column was dropped.
- `apiKeyRateLimit` — UNLOGGED, PK `(apiKeyId, windowStart)`, `requestCount`.
- RLS/RPC functions: `get_claims`, `get_company_id_from_api_key`, `get_api_key_scopes`,
  `check_api_key_rate_limit`, `create_public_user`.

## Config (`packages/env/src/index.ts`, re-exported by `@carbon/auth`)

`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`,
`SESSION_SECRET`, `SESSION_KEY` (`"auth"`), `SESSION_MAX_AGE`,
`REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN_THRESHOLD`, `DOMAIN`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `CarbonEdition`,
`STRIPE_BYPASS_COMPANY_IDS`, `IS_VERCEL`, Turnstile + OAuth-provider keys.

## Gotchas

- `getUserClaims` swallows Redis errors and falls back to the DB; a stale cache is the
  usual cause of "Access Denied" after a permission change — invalidate the cache key.
- `verifyAuthSession` (the `requireAuthSession(request, { verify: true })` path) caches
  only its **positive** verdict in Redis for 60s, keyed by a SHA-256 of the access
  token. Negatives are never cached — `getAuthAccountByAccessToken` also returns null
  on a transient network error. Bounds how long a deleted/deactivated account keeps
  being accepted; signing out never revoked a live access token anyway.
- ERP's `~/modules/users/users.server` re-exports `getUserClaims` from `@carbon/auth`;
  it used to carry a drifted copy that missed the cache TTL. Don't reintroduce one.
- Service-role clients bypass RLS — only use behind `bypassRls` + employee role.
- API key `scopes: {}` denies, not grants. Don't assume empty = full access.
- Edition matters: Enterprise rejects unknown-user login; Cloud gates API keys by plan
  and enforces the bot check (BotID on Vercel, Turnstile elsewhere).
