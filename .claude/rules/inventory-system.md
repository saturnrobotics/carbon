# Inventory System

Carbon's inventory tracks item/material quantities across locations and storage
units, plus serial/batch/lot tracking, receipts/shipments, transfers, and picking.

## Code (real paths)

All inventory service code lives in a single module: `apps/erp/app/modules/inventory/`

- `inventory.service.ts` — the one service file (~90+ exported functions, no `service/` subfolder)
- `inventory.models.ts` — Zod validators + exported enums/helpers
- `lineage.server.ts` — traceability/genealogy graph computation
- `types.ts`, `index.ts`
- `ui/` — feature folders: `Inventory/`, `Receipts/`, `Shipments/`, `StockTransfers/`,
  `WarehouseTransfers/`, `StorageUnits/`, `StorageTypes/`, `Kanbans/`, `PickingLists/`,
  `Batches/`, `ShippingMethods/`, `Traceability/`

Key service functions (verified):
- `getInventoryItems` / `getInventoryItemsCount` — call the `get_inventory_quantities` RPC
  (args `{ location_id, company_id }`, `count: "exact"`); supports search + generic filters.
- `getItemLedgerPage` — paginated item-ledger history for an item at a location.
- `insertManualInventoryAdjustment` — thin wrapper over the **`post-inventory-adjustment`
  edge function** (MES has a matching wrapper in `apps/mes/app/services/inventory.service.ts`).
  The edge function owns positive/negative/set-quantity **plus Scrap/Unscrap**
  (`.ai/specs/2026-08-06-scrap-unscrap-flow.md`) resolution, tracked-entity storage-unit
  transfers, expiry override, batch/serial assignment — and, in one Kysely transaction, maintains
  `costLedger` layers (consume via `calculateCOGS` on decreases, new layer at current cost on
  increases) and posts a journal (Dr/Cr `resolveInventoryAccount` vs
  `accountDefault.inventoryAdjustmentVarianceAccount`) when `companySettings.accountingEnabled`.
  `post-inventory-count` books its variances through the same shared core
  (`functions/shared/post-adjustment.ts`). Storage-unit transfers post no GL. The valuation
  workbench tie-out offers a **Reconcile** action (`createInventoryReconciliationJournal`) that
  drafts an adjusting journal for any residual pre-feature variance.
  **Scrap** = a `Negative Adjmt.` movement with `documentType='Scrap'` +
  `itemLedger.scrapReasonId`, offset to `accountDefault.scrapAccount` (fallback
  `inventoryAdjustmentVarianceAccount`), tracked entity → `Scrapped` (keeps its
  quantity; partial batch scrap splits per the identity-flip convention).
  **Unscrap** (Oracle Return-from-Scrap) restores a `Scrapped` entity to
  `Available` at the **original scrapped cost** (resolved from the scrap
  movement's `costLedger` via `resolve-unscrap-cost.ts`) and bin, linked by
  `correctionOfItemLedgerId`; ERP UI = the Unscrap row action on the tracked-
  entities table (`UnscrapModal`, no location and **no scrap reason** submitted —
  both resolved server-side; the reason is inherited from the original scrap
  movement so unscrap can't be mis-classified, and the UI collects only an
  optional comment).
  Scrap journals carry ScrapReason/WorkCenter/Employee dimensions; the single
  `scrapAccount` + dimensions replaces per-reason account mapping by design.
  The **ScrapReason** dimension is seeded active by default (a `dimension` row per
  company group, from `functions/lib/seed.data.ts`; backfilled to existing groups by
  `20260808114732_backfill-scrap-reason-dimension.sql`). Like CustomerType/ItemPostingGroup
  it is entity-backed — its values resolve live from the `scrapReason` table via
  `getEntityDimensionValues`/`getEntityValuesByIds` (accounting.service.ts), so adding a
  scrap reason immediately makes it a selectable/taggable dimension value with no sync step.
  A tag is only written when the entity type has an **active** `dimension` row — a scrap
  posting's ScrapReason `extraDimension` is dropped in `post-adjustment.ts` if the dimension
  was deleted/deactivated for that company group.
- `correctStockMovement` — wraps the **`correct-stock-movement` edge function**: fixes any
  posted `itemLedger` row by booking ONE opposite (delta) movement linked to the original's
  correction root via `itemLedger.correctionOfItemLedgerId`, carrying the ORIGINAL's
  `postingDate` and (when accounting is on) posting its journal into the period containing
  that date via `getAccountingPeriodForDate` (throws on Locked/Closed). The delta is
  `correctedQuantity − effective` (effective = root + all prior corrections in the group),
  so repeat corrections converge. `documentType`/`documentId` are copied from the original
  so document-scoped movement views keep including the fix. Entry point: "Correct Quantity"
  context action on `StockMovementsTable` → `stock-movements/$ledgerId/correct` route (whose
  loader returns the authoritative effective quantity for the modal pre-fill). Corrections
  render as normal flat rows with an `isCorrection` badge — no nesting/expandable grouping.
  Inventory counts have NO count-level rectify; Posted is terminal.
- Storage units: `getStorageUnit(s)`, `getStorageUnitRoots`, `getStorageUnitChildren`,
  `getStorageUnitTree`, `getStorageUnitsTreeForLocation`, `getDefaultStorageUnitForJob`,
  `getDefaultStorageUnitOrStorageUnitWithHighestQuantity` (these are the picking/job defaults).
- Tracking: `getTrackedEntities`, `getAvailableTrackedEntities` (RPC `get_available_tracked_entities`),
  `getSerialNumbersForItem`, `getBatchNumbersForItem`, `getShelfLifeForItems`, `getPickOrder` (FEFO/FIFO).
- Picking: `generatePickingList`, `getPickingListAvailability` (RPC `get_picking_list_availability`),
  `getPickingSchedule` (RPC `get_picking_schedule`). These honor `itemSupersession`
  (`20260730143512_picking-supersession.sql` + `inventory/supersession-pick.ts`
  `resolvePickTarget`): `Prefer New`/`Stock Only` redirect a pick to the effective successor
  (× `conversionFactor`); `Consume First` redirects only when the predecessor is out of warehouse
  stock; `No Stock` (and `Stock Only` without an effective successor) is dropped from the schedule
  and skipped in generation. Note picking's redirect rules differ from the MRP/job-creation map
  (`functions/lib/supersession-pick.ts`, which redirects only `Consume First`/`Prefer New`) —
  for picking, `Stock Only` must not be picked for production. A substituted line's `itemId`
  differs from its `jobMaterial.itemId` (no new column); the availability RPC reports the
  line's OWN pick item's warehouse on-hand with NO successor fold-in — a substituted line
  already targets the successor, and folding successor stock into a line still targeting the
  predecessor would mask a real shortage and double-count the successor.

Validators in `inventory.models.ts`: `inventoryAdjustmentValidator`, `receiptValidator`,
`shipmentValidator`, `stockTransferValidator`, `warehouseTransferValidator`, `storageUnitValidator`,
`storageTypeValidator`, `kanbanValidator`, `pickingListValidator`, `pickingListLineValidator`,
`shippingMethodValidator`, `batchPropertyValidator`. Also exports `itemLedgerTypes` etc.

## Database (current schema)

- **`itemLedger`** — source of truth for on-hand quantity. Key cols: `entryType` (`itemLedgerType`),
  `documentType` (`itemLedgerDocumentType`), `postingDate`, `itemId`, `locationId`,
  `storageUnitId`, `quantity`, `trackedEntityId`, and `trackedEntityStatus` (denormalized from
  `trackedEntity.status` — added `20260420112047`, lets reads filter status without a JOIN).
- **`itemLedgerSnapshot`** (matview, `20260713235406`) — snapshot of the immutable UNTRACKED
  ledger rows (`trackedEntityId IS NULL`, `createdAt` older than 1h) per item/company/location:
  `quantity`, `consumed30/90`, `storageUnitIds`, `snapshotCutoff`. pg_cron refresh every 30 min.
  Read only inside the SECURITY DEFINER quantity functions (REVOKEd from PostgREST roles); live
  reads add rows past `snapshotCutoff` plus ALL tracked rows, so results stay exact. Distinct
  from `itemStockQuantities` — since `20260812002454` a real TABLE maintained
  transactionally by a statement-level handler on `itemLedger`
  (`apply_item_stock_quantities`, attached via `attach_statement_handler`), no
  longer an approximate matview. Excludes `Rejected` tracked stock; exact, with a
  nightly `reconcile-item-stock-quantities` cron as drift backstop. Read by
  RealtimeDataProvider (with realtime push), the workflow engine's
  `item.quantityOnHand` operation, and the MRP edge function's on-hand input.
  The old `itemInventory` rollup table is DEAD — its maintaining trigger was dropped in
  `20250209170952_shipment.sql`; don't read or write it.
- **`storageUnit`** — bins/locations. Renamed from `shelf` (`20260417000100`); supports nesting via
  `parentId` and `storageTypeIds TEXT[]` (`20260417000200`). Cols: `id`, `name`, `locationId`,
  `warehouseId`, `parentId`, `storageTypeIds`, `active`.
- **`storageType`** — storage-unit type definitions (`20260417000000`).
- **`trackedEntity`** — serial/batch/lot tracking (`20250225145619`). Cols: `id`, `quantity`,
  `status` (`trackedEntityStatus`), `sourceDocument(Id)`, `attributes JSONB` (batch/serial #, supplier…),
  `expirationDate`. Companion `trackedActivity` + `trackedActivityInput`/`Output` record movements.
- **`warehouseTransfer` / `warehouseTransferLine`** — inter-location moves (`20250726000000`).
  Status enum `warehouseTransferStatus`. Lines carry from/to location + storage unit, shipped/received qty.
- **`stockTransfer*`** — intra-location moves (separate from warehouse transfers).
- **`pickMethod`** — default storage unit for picking an item at a location (`defaultStorageUnitId`).
- **`itemPlanning`** / **`itemReplenishment`** — reorder/planning params and replenishment strategy.
- **`enforcementRule`** + assignment tables — ONE table for storage and sales rules, discriminated by `family` (`20260817143022`/`20260817143512`). Storage-family reads must filter `family = 'storage'`. Lineage: `itemRule` → `customRule` → `storageRule` → merged into `enforcementRule`.

`get_inventory_quantities(company_id TEXT, location_id TEXT, item_id TEXT DEFAULT NULL)` — the central
read. Newest definition is `20260713235406_item-ledger-snapshot.sql` (snapshot + delta via
`itemLedgerSnapshot`; `item_id` restricts to one item for detail-page loads). Returns ~52 cols:
item identity + material props, planning fields, and quantities `quantityOnHand`, `quantityOnHold`,
`quantityRejected` (status-aware: excludes `Rejected`, surfaces `On Hold`), `quantityOnSalesOrder`,
`quantityOnPurchaseOrder`, `quantityOnProductionOrder`, `quantityOnProductionDemand`, `demandForecast`,
`usageLast30Days`, `usageLast90Days`, `daysRemaining`, plus `storageTypeIds`/`storageUnitIds` arrays.
Aggregates from `itemLedger`, open `purchaseOrder(Line)`, `salesOrder(Line)`, `job`/`jobMaterial`,
and `demandForecast`/`demandActual`.

Relevant enums: `itemLedgerType`, `itemLedgerDocumentType` (includes `Scrap`,
`20260807090400`), `trackedEntityStatus`
(`Available`, `Reserved`, `On Hold`, `Consumed`, `Rejected`, `Scrapped`), `warehouseTransferStatus`,
`itemTrackingType`, `itemReplenishmentSystem`, `itemReorderingPolicy`.

## Gotchas

- **Migrations are timestamp-ordered; tables get renamed.** `shelf`→`storageUnit`/`shelfId`→`storageUnitId`,
  `customRule`→`storageRule`→`enforcementRule` (merged with `salesRule`). Grep the NEWEST migration for the real name; never trust an older one or the
  old cache. The `shelf`→`storageUnit` rename was split across paired migrations
  `20260417000100` (rename, M2) + `..000300` (recreate dependents, M4) — they must apply together.
- **Short-closed PO lines don't count as incoming supply.** `get_inventory_quantities`,
  `get_job_quantity_on_hand`, and the `openPurchaseOrderLines` view (MRP) all filter open-PO supply with
  `pol."receivedComplete" = false` (`20260708204214`). A line short-closed via
  `shortClosePurchaseOrderLine` ("Stop Receiving") keeps `quantityToReceive > 0` but is excluded from
  `quantityOnPurchaseOrder`.
- **`get_inventory_quantities` has many revisions.** Always read the newest (`20260713235406`), not the
  first match. `quantityOnHand` is status-aware: `Rejected` tracked entities are excluded, and tracked
  rows are always computed live (never from `itemLedgerSnapshot`) so status flips are never stale.
- **The auto-generated MCP reference (`.claude/rules/mcp-tools-reference.md`) is stale** for storage units —
  it still lists `getShelf`/`getDefaultShelfForJob`. The real service exports `getStorageUnit*` /
  `getDefaultStorageUnitForJob`. Trust the service file.
- On-hand math comes from `itemLedger` (and the `get_inventory_quantities` RPC), not from summing
  `trackedEntity` directly. The old `itemInventory` table is orphaned (trigger dropped
  `20250209170952`) — never read or write it.
