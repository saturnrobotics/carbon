# Carbon ERP MCP Server

The ERP exposes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that wraps the module
service functions as ERP tools. It lives entirely under
`apps/erp/app/routes/api+/mcp+/`.

> Don't recreate the old per-tool dump — it goes stale instantly (it still listed
> `inventory_getShelf`, removed when `shelf` was renamed to `storageUnit`). The
> live tool list is `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/mcp+/lib/tool-metadata.json`;
> `describe_tool` / `search_tools` read from it at runtime.
>
> That manifest is **gitignored build output** (1.9 MB, rewritten wholesale on every
> run — it churned 250+ commits). It is produced by `pnpm generate:mcp`, which runs
> from `postinstall` and as the turbo root task `//#generate:mcp` that `typecheck`,
> `build` and `test` depend on — so a fresh clone regenerates it before anything
> imports it. The committed record of the published contract is its small companion
> `tool-manifest.digest.json`: one line per operation carrying classification,
> permission, injectAuth, argument count and a hash of the schema, so a contract
> change is still one visible line in review. `pnpm check:manifest` regenerates and
> fails if the digest is stale; pre-commit runs it when a service, models or
> generator file is staged.

## Endpoint & transport

- Route: `POST /api/mcp` (`api+/mcp+/_index.ts`). `loader` rejects non-POST (405);
  `OPTIONS` → 204 with CORS. JSON-RPC over
  `WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` (`enableJsonResponse: true`,
  `sessionIdGenerator: undefined` — stateless, no session).
- A fresh `McpServer` (`createMcpServer(ctx)`) is built per request and connected
  to a fresh transport.

## Public discovery endpoints (unauthenticated)

Three GET routes let an agent or registry find and connect to the server without
a credential. All derive their URLs from `getAppUrl() || url.origin`, so a
self-hosted / ITAR instance advertises its OWN endpoint — never hard-code
`app.carbon.ms`.

- `GET /.well-known/mcp.json` (`routes/[.]well-known.mcp[.]json.ts` → `lib/manifest.ts`
  `buildMcpManifest(origin)`) — the MCP registry `server.json`: `remotes[]` with
  `type: "streamable-http"`, tool/module counts derived from `tool-metadata.json`.
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` + `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
  (routes at the app root) — RFC 9728 / OAuth AS discovery for the connector flow.
- `GET /agent-setup/prompt.md` (`routes/agent-setup.prompt[.]md.tsx` →
  `lib/agent-setup-prompt.ts` `buildAgentSetupPrompt(origin)`) — an agent-facing
  markdown "connect your MCP client" doc (modeled on Cloudflare's
  `agent-setup/prompt.md`). The prose is the raw file `lib/agent-setup-prompt.md`,
  imported with Vite `?raw`; `{{MCP_URL}}` / `{{ORIGIN}}` tokens are replaced at
  request time. The template is a colocation file, NOT a route — remix-flat-routes
  only promotes `index|route|layout|page|_x|x.route` names, so a plain-named `.md`
  under `lib/` is ignored (same reason `manifest.ts` there isn't a route).

## Auth (`_index.ts` → `resolveAuth`)

Three ways in, resolved in this order:

1. **OAuth bearer** — `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where the token is **not**
   prefixed `crbn_`. The token is SHA-256 hashed (`hashOAuthSecret`) and looked up
   in the `oauthToken` table; expired/missing → 401. On hit, a user-scoped client
   is minted via `getUserScopedClient(userId)`. This is the remote
   Claude/MCP-connector path (OAuth AS routes live at `_oauth+/` plus
   `[.]well-known.oauth-*` at the routes root;
   `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` advertises `resource: <origin>/api/mcp`,
   `scopes_supported: ["mcp:tools"]`).
2. **API key** — `Bearer crbn_…` is rewritten to the `carbon-key` header, or the
   `carbon-key` header is sent directly; falls through to `requirePermissions`.
3. **No auth** → 401 with a `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=…` header
   so clients can discover the OAuth flow.

Auth always yields an `McpContext` = `{ client, companyId, companyGroupId, userId }`
(`lib/types.ts`). `companyId`/`userId` come from the auth context and are injected
server-side — never trusted from tool arguments.

## The 3 meta-tools (the ONLY tools actually registered)

To avoid context exhaustion, `server.registerTool` registers just three discovery
tools (`lib/server.ts`); the ~1200 ERP functions are reached through them, not
registered individually:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_tools` | Discover tool names. Filters: `query`, `module`, `classification` (`READ`/`WRITE`/`DESTRUCTIVE`), `limit`/`offset`. Reads `tool-metadata.json`. |
| `describe_tool` | Return the JSON-Schema + classification + description for one tool name. |
| `call_tool` | Execute any ERP tool: `{ name, arguments }`. `arguments` may arrive as a JSON string and is normalized to an object. |

## How `call_tool` actually runs a tool (the canonical oRPC dispatch)

`call_tool` does **not** go back through the MCP protocol — it calls
`callOperation(name, ctx, args)` from `api+/v1+/lib/call.server.ts`, the ONE
server-side entry point shared by MCP, the in-app agent, and the workflow
dispatcher (`apps/erp/app/routes/api+/inngest.ts`). There is no separate
`direct-executor.ts` any more; it was deleted when all three callers migrated.

- `callOperation` resolves the manifest entry (`operationsByName`) and runs the
  real oRPC procedure via server-side `call()` — gate middleware included, so an
  **API-key** caller is scope-checked per operation (403 when the key lacks
  `<module>_<action>` for the company). OAuth-connector and in-process
  (`authKind: "session"`) callers skip the scope gate; RLS/role bounds them.
- The service registry lives at `api+/v1+/lib/registry.server.ts` (the 15 module
  namespaces); the arg assembly lives in `api+/v1+/lib/dispatch.server.ts`.
- **Input is validated** against the operation's own schema before dispatch.
  `router.server.ts` wires `.input(jsonSchemaInput(meta.schema))` from
  `@carbon/api/schema`, which converts the manifest's JSON Schema back to zod at
  first use (`z.fromJSONSchema`; no validator library is involved). Because
  `callOperation` runs the real procedure, this covers MCP, the agent and
  workflows as well as HTTP — a malformed payload gets a 400 naming the field
  instead of silently reaching a service. `.output()` deliberately keeps the
  pass-through `jsonSchema()`: `shapeHttpBody` rewrites the body, so a correct
  response does not match the declared response schema. The validator preserves
  unknown keys (no generated schema sets `additionalProperties: false`) and
  accepts a lone wrapper's contents sent flat, since the dispatcher does too.
- `tool-metadata.json` provides `serviceParams` (positional arg order, e.g.
  `["client", "args"]`) and `injectAuth`. The dispatch builds the positional
  arg array: `client`/`userId`/`companyId`/`companyGroupId` come from `ctx`; a
  service whose param is `db` is handed `getDatabaseClient()`; payload params are
  stamped with auth fields via `enrichWithAuthContext` (now in
  `dispatch.server.ts`). A param literally named `args` is stamped too, and
  which wire shape it takes is read off the operation's schema: a declared `args`
  object means the body wraps it (`{ args: {...} }`) and the inner object is
  unwrapped; a flat schema means the body already IS the args object. A flat body
  is still accepted either way. A param the schema declares as a **scalar** is
  passed `undefined` when no key matches rather than being handed the whole
  payload object — that fallback made `deleteApiKey` run `.eq("id", {...})` and
  return `200 null`. Reading a key by the param's own name is likewise gated
  (`addressesWholeParam`): a service whose sole payload param is a destructured
  object can share its name with one of that object's FIELDS —
  `insertNote(client, note: { note, documentId, … })` — and reading `body.note`
  there handed the service the note STRING instead of the record. The schema
  decides: a wrapper op declares one property named for the param, so read it; an
  op listing the param's own fields is describing it, so pass the whole body.
  `_operation` and any property that is itself another serviceParam (`args`, and
  scalar siblings like `locationId`) don't count toward that, since each is
  addressed on its own pass. When a payload param is an **array** of rows,
  `enrichWithAuthContext` stamps `createdBy` into each element (insert only) —
  the top-level stamp never reached inside, so a NOT NULL `createdBy` on the row
  table (e.g. `quoteLinePrice`) used to fail. Only `createdBy` is injected per
  element; `companyId`/`updatedBy` are left to the service, since element keys
  spread straight into an INSERT.
- Blocked tools (`lib/mcp-blocked-tools.ts`, `MCP_BLOCKED_TOOL_NAMES`) are
  rejected in `call_tool`, in `callOperation`, and (belt-and-braces) in the
  `gate()` middleware — though the primary gate is that the generator excludes
  them from the manifest entirely. Tenant-level operations belong here:
  `settings_insertCompany` and `settings_deleteSubsidiary` are both bare
  `company` writes whose only scoping is a companyId the dispatcher fills from
  the caller's own key, so an empty body would create or destroy a tenant. Their
  "internal users only" gate lives in the settings ROUTE (`isInternalEmail`),
  which no API/MCP call passes through. So do operations whose table carries
  **user-scoped RLS** (`"createdBy"::uuid = auth.uid()` — `note`,
  `maintenanceDispatchComment` and the six `*Favorite` tables, migration
  `20260228000000_rls-refactor-3.sql`). An API key authenticates with the
  `carbon-key` header rather than a Supabase JWT, so `auth.uid()` is NULL and the
  predicate never matches. The failure splits by verb, and the silent half is the
  reason these are blocked rather than left to fail: an INSERT raises a visible RLS
  error, but an UPDATE/DELETE matching zero rows is not an error — PostgREST
  returns success, so `deleteNote` answered `200` while the row stayed untouched.
  `*_upsertMaintenanceDispatchComment` and `shared_insertNote` are deliberately NOT
  blocked: their INSERT path is companyId-scoped and works. The upserts' `update`
  branch still no-ops silently — making it work is an RLS decision, not an app-code
  one.
- **A thrown service error is mapped to a 422 carrying its message** by the
  `mapThrownErrors` middleware (`lib/base.server.ts`), composed ahead of `gate`
  in `router.server.ts`. Services are meant to return the Supabase
  `{ data, error }` envelope, but ~51 of them `throw` instead; oRPC rewrites any
  non-`ORPCError` throw to a 500 and keeps the message only as `cause`, which the
  encoder drops — so HTTP answered a bad id opaquely while MCP showed the real
  text (`callOperation` reads `err.message` itself). Classification is by
  constructor, since the ERP service layer has no domain-error class: a plain
  `Error` is surfaced, while `TypeError`/`ReferenceError`/`RangeError`/
  `SyntaxError` keep their opaque 500 because they mean Carbon has a bug. The
  mapper must never attach `data.supabase` — `callOperation` keys its
  `Database error:` envelope off that field.
- `eliminationClient` is a **context param**, filled from `context.client` (which
  is what the service itself defaults it to). Left out of the generator's
  `CONTEXT_PARAMS` it became a required field a caller cannot express — a
  Supabase client — so the two consolidated-balance ops failed every call.
- Supabase query builders returned by services are awaited and the
  `{ data, error, count }` envelope is **unwrapped by the dispatch**:
  `callOperation` returns `{ success: true, data, count? }` or
  `{ success: false, error, errorKind: "database" | "execution" }`. A Supabase
  failure keeps MCP's exact `Database error: ${JSON.stringify(error)}` text
  (the raw error rides on `ORPCError.data.supabase`), and HTTP callers get the
  Postgres `code`/`details`/`hint` in the 400 body.
- The dispatch behavior is pinned by
  `api+/v1+/lib/dispatch-parity.test.ts` (golden cases carried over from the
  deleted `executeFunction`) — a change there is a behavior change for MCP,
  the agent, workflows and HTTP at once.

## Tool metadata & the generator (`scripts/generate-mcp.ts`)

`tool-metadata.json` is **generated**, never hand-edited. Run
`npx tsx scripts/generate-mcp.ts`; it parses every `apps/erp/app/modules/*/*.service.ts`
(falling back to the `.ee`-licensed `<module>.ee.service.ts` — e.g. `accounting`),
plus an optional server-only companion `<module>.mcp.server.ts` when present (for MCP
functions that must import `*.server` modules — see the gotcha below — e.g.
`production.mcp.server.ts`; the registry (`api+/v1+/lib/registry.server.ts`) merges its
exports into the same module namespace), and writes `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/mcp+/lib/tool-metadata.json`
(`{ generated, totalTools, modules, tools }`). Each tool entry:
`{ name, module, classification, description, paramCount, serviceParams, injectAuth, schema }`.

- **Classification** (`classifyFunction`): `delete*` → `DESTRUCTIVE`;
  `get|list|fetch|search|find|count|check|is|has*` → `READ`; a WRITE whose
  **body issues a delete** (`.delete(` / `.deleteFrom(`, detected by
  `functionBodyDeletes`) → `DESTRUCTIVE` too — a delete-and-reinsert `upsert*`
  (e.g. `upsertQuoteLinePrices`, `replace*Steps`, favourite toggles) is
  destructive-by-omission and the client must treat it as such; everything else →
  `WRITE`. Drives the MCP annotations (`READ_ONLY_/WRITE_/DESTRUCTIVE_ANNOTATIONS`
  in `lib/types.ts`).
- **injectAuth** (`computeInjectAuth`): keyed off the **name verb, not the
  classification** — only `READ` takes `["companyId"]`. `upsert|create|insert|
  add|new|copy|duplicate|generate*` → `["companyId","createdBy","updatedBy"]`;
  `update|set|sync|run|…*` → `["companyId","updatedBy"]`; anything else (incl. a
  genuine `delete*`) → `["companyId"]`. A DESTRUCTIVE-classified `upsert*` still
  inserts rows, so it keeps its `createdBy` — the label is only a caller hint.

- **`_operation`** (`usesOperationDiscriminator`): a tool whose service picks
  insert-vs-update by testing for an audit field on the payload gets a **required**
  `_operation: "create" | "update"` in its schema — the schema is the only marker,
  there is no parallel metadata flag. **BOTH discriminator directions count**:
  `if ("createdBy" in …)` (create-branch first, e.g. `upsertQuoteOperation`) AND
  `if ("updatedBy" in …)` (update-branch first, e.g. `upsertQuoteMaterial`,
  `upsertJobMaterial`, `upsertJob`, `upsertProductionQuantity`, `upsertPartner`,
  `upsertPeriodCloseTaskDefinition`). The generator only matched `"createdBy" in`
  until it was broadened — so the inverted ones shipped WITHOUT `_operation`, and
  since `enrichWithAuthContext` always stamped `updatedBy`, their `"updatedBy" in`
  test was always true: every create was forced down the UPDATE branch, matched
  zero rows for a fresh id, and returned **PGRST116** — a silent no-op the customer
  hit trying to add quote/job materials over the connector. (A few — `upsertJobOperation`,
  `upsertContractor`, `upsertGaugeCalibrationRecord` — got `_operation` anyway from
  a secondary `"createdBy" in` in the body, but were broken the same way until the
  dispatch fix below, because their PRIMARY branch is `"updatedBy" in`.)
  The dispatch (`api+/v1+/lib/dispatch.server.ts`) strips `_operation` from the args
  (top level *and* the `{ args: {...} }` wrapper) before building the payload, then
  stamps audit fields **symmetrically**: on `"create"` it stamps `createdBy` and
  **suppresses `updatedBy`**; on `"update"` it stamps `updatedBy` and **suppresses
  `createdBy`** — so either convention lands on the branch the caller asked for, and
  the create path matches the create-variant service type / UI insert (createdBy, no
  updatedBy). With no `_operation` (operation `undefined`) both audit fields are
  stamped, as before. Missing/invalid `_operation` on such a tool is rejected before
  the service is called; `call_tool.arguments` is `z.any()`, so the dispatch is the gate.

## The 15 modules (current `tool-metadata.json`)

`account` · `accounting` · `documents` · `inventory` · `invoicing` · `items` ·
`people` · `production` · `purchasing` · `quality` · `resources` · `sales` ·
`settings` · `shared` · `users`. Each maps 1:1 to a
`apps/erp/app/modules/<module>/<module>.service.ts` namespace (accounting is the
`.ee`-licensed `accounting.ee.service.ts`; the registry key stays `accounting`).

<!-- UNVERIFIED: exact per-module/total tool counts (~1200) drift on every regen — read tool-metadata.json for the live number, don't trust a hardcoded count. -->

## Gotchas

- The generator reads a service's **parameter list textually**, but resolves more
  shapes than it used to. An **inline** array-of-objects
  (`prices: { quantity: number; ... }[]`) now publishes as a typed
  `{"type":"array","items":{...}}`; a `z.infer<typeof V>` validator param resolves
  `V.merge(z.object({...}))` / `applyX(...)` wrappers / referenced `*Validator`s
  (same models file) into real fields; and an `errorMap: () => (...)` inside a
  validator no longer truncates the fields after it. A `z.infer<typeof V>`
  **nested inside an inline object type** also resolves — bare, `Partial<...>`,
  `PickPartial<..., "k">` (listed keys turn optional), `Omit<..., "k">`, an
  indexed access (`z.infer<...>["lines"]`), and an `& { ... }` intersection —
  as do parenthesized discriminated-upsert union branches
  (`(Omit<z.infer<...>> & {...}) | (...)`). Also resolved:
  `Database["public"]["Enums"][...]` (real value enums) and
  `Database["public"]["Tables"][t]["Row"|"Insert"|"Update"]` (real columns,
  auth-injected fields stripped) via `scripts/lib/db-types.ts` over the
  generated types; `Array<T>`/`ReadonlyArray<T>`/`Record<string, V>`/
  `Partial<X>` generics; general `A & B` intersections; `(typeof x)[number]`
  const arrays (real values when the registry has them); and bare **type
  aliases declared in the module's own sources** (service file, `types.ts`,
  models, and the shared equivalents). This matters on WRITE tools: an untyped
  `{}` invites an MCP client to guess field names, and a guessed
  `contact.phone` reached the insert and failed with PGRST204 (pinned by
  `apps/erp/test/mcp-tool-metadata.test.ts`). Still opaque, deliberately:
  compiler-derived types (`ReturnType`/`Awaited`), aliases imported from other
  packages, `Map<...>` params, and genuine `Json`/`unknown`/rich-text fields.
  Keep `//` comments above the function, not inside the parameter list (a
  comment there is parsed as a property name).
- A service whose first parameter is `db` (a Kysely transaction client) is served
  `getDatabaseClient()` by `dispatch.server.ts`, the same way `client` is served
  the supabase one. A first parameter named anything else falls through to the
  positional-argument branches and receives a business argument as its client.
- Don't enumerate individual tools in docs — `search_tools` is the source of truth.
  Names follow `<module>_<verb><Entity>` (e.g. `sales_getCustomers`,
  `inventory_upsertStorageUnit`).
- "Shelf" was renamed to **storage unit**: use `inventory_*StorageUnit*`, not
  `getShelf` (which no longer exists). "Shelf life" (`*ShelfLife*`) is a
  *different*, still-current concept — don't conflate them.
- To block a tool from MCP, add its `<module>_<func>` name to
  `MCP_BLOCKED_TOOL_NAMES` and regenerate metadata.
- **A `{module}.service.ts` must not import a `*.server` module** (`@carbon/auth/users.server`,
  `@carbon/ee/storage-rules.server`, an app `*.server.ts`, …) — even via `await import(...)`.
  The module barrel (`~/modules/{module}`) re-exports the service, and client components
  value-import that barrel for validators/enums, so the service is in the **client** bundle;
  React Router's `react-router:dot-server` plugin then fails the build with *"Server-only
  module referenced by client"*. Put such MCP write functions in a server-only companion
  `{module}.mcp.server.ts` instead (never re-exported by the barrel). The generator parses it
  and `registry.server.ts` spreads its exports into the module namespace, so the tool names and
  metadata are identical to a service-file function. Precedent: `production.mcp.server.ts`
  holds `issueMaterial` / `completeJob`.
