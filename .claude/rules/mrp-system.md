# MRP (Material Requirements Planning)

MRP nets demand against supply per item/location/period and projects on-hand
forward so users can create planned purchase orders (purchasing) and jobs
(production). It runs **IN-PROCESS in Node** via `runMrp` (exported from
`@carbon/planning`, source `packages/planning/src/mrp/mrp.ts`), driven
either by an **Inngest** scheduled cron or a manual route POST — NOT a Supabase
edge function (the old `mrp` Deno function and its `config.toml` entry were
DELETED), and NOT Trigger.dev. `runMrp(client, db, payload)` takes an injected
service-role Supabase client (PostgREST reads) and a Kysely handle (the atomic
Phase-7 write) and throws on failure.

## Run flow (inputs → compute → outputs)

1. **Scheduled job** — `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/scheduled/mrp.ts`.
   `inngest.createFunction({ id: "mrp", retries: 2 }, { cron: "0 */3 * * *" }, …)`
   — every 3 hours. A `find-companies` step selects all rows from `company`,
   then **one `step.run` per company** (`mrp-<companyId>`) calls
   `runMrp(serviceRole, getJobDatabaseClient(), { type: "company", id,
   companyId, userId: "system" })` **in-process** (`runMrp` throws on failure;
   the loop try/catches per step and returns `{ companies, failed }`). Every
   Inngest step is one HTTP request to `/api/inngest`, so a step's ceiling is
   that Vercel function's max duration — set project-wide in the Vercel
   dashboard (Settings → Functions), NOT via a route `config` export: a
   `maxDuration` in the route config splits a second server bundle in the
   @vercel/react-router preset and the Vite 8 css-post plugin fails the build
   ("Unable to get file name for unknown file"). All companies in ONE step was one invocation, hit
   `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT` as the tenant count grew after the
   `company`-enumeration change below, and every retry restarted from company
   #1. There is no location-scoped cron — only company-wide.

   It enumerated `companyPlan` until 2026-08-26. MRP is not in `FEATURE_PLANS`,
   so that was never a billing gate — just a convenient list of companies — but
   the table is only written by Stripe checkout and is seeded nowhere, so every
   self-hosted, community and local-dev install had an empty work list and
   silently never ran MRP, reporting a green Inngest run. Do not reintroduce it:
   the work list is `company`, and a company with no plan row must still run.
   On **Cloud only**, companies whose `stripeSubscriptionStatus` is `'Canceled'`
   are skipped, because `weekly.ts` deletes those. The selection rule is the pure
   `selectCompaniesForMrp` (`scheduled/mrp-companies.ts`), unit-tested in its
   sibling `.test.ts`; the scheduler logs a `warn` when the list comes back
   empty, so "no work" can never again look like "worked fine".

   Both reads go through `fetchAllFromTable` with a stable `.order("id")` — the
   same reason the edge function pages (below): `max_rows = 1000` truncates a
   bare select, and the dev stack does not enforce the cap, so a dropped tail is
   invisible locally. A failed `company` read **throws**; returning would make
   the step succeed having planned for nobody, which is this function's whole
   bug class. A failed `companyPlan` read does not — it leaves `plans` null and
   plans for everyone, which is the fail-safe direction.

2. **Manual trigger** — POST `apps/erp/app/routes/api+/mrp.ts` (permission
   `update: "inventory"`). Reads `?location` query param; calls
   `runMRP(getCarbonServiceRole(), { type: locationId ? "location" : "company",
   id: locationId ?? companyId, companyId, userId })`. `runMRP` lives in
   `apps/erp/app/modules/production/production.service.ts`; it dynamic-imports
   `runMrp` from `@carbon/planning`, gets a Kysely handle via
   `getSchedulingDb()`, calls `runMrp(client, db, params)` **in-process**, and
   preserves the `{ data, error }` shape (catching the throw). The planning tables
   submit to this via `path.to.api.mrp(locationId)`.

3. **In-process engine** — `packages/planning/src/mrp/mrp.ts`
   (`runMrp(client, db, payload)`, Node, ~1130 lines). Reads go through the
   injected service-role Supabase client (PostgREST); the atomic Phase-7 write
   goes through the injected Kysely handle. Payload validator accepts
   `type: "company" | "location" | "item" | "job" | "purchaseOrder" |
   "salesOrder"`, `id?` (required for non-company), `companyId`, `userId`.
   Computation engine is
   `packages/database/supabase/functions/lib/mrp-engine.ts` (`explodeBom(...)`),
   which STAYS in the edge-lib (still used by the Deno `recalculate` function +
   job-quantities-engine) and is reached from Node via the
   `@carbon/database/mrp-engine` barrel.

   - **Periods**: generates/fetches weekly `period` rows ~18 weeks (126 days)
     forward from today (`"Week"` granularity). <!-- UNVERIFIED: exact week count not re-confirmed line-by-line; old doc said 72, code comment said 18 -->
   - **Inputs (demand)**: views `openSalesOrderLines`, `openJobMaterialLines`,
     plus the user-entered `demandProjection` for forecast netting. Don't conflate it
     with the output: MRP **consumes `demandProjection`** (user-entered) and **writes
     `demandForecast`** (rebuilt each run — see Outputs below).
   - **Inputs (supply)**: views `openProductionOrders`, `openPurchaseOrderLines`.
   - **Inputs (on-hand)**: the `itemStockQuantities` table (trigger-maintained,
     `20260812002454`) — an indexed per-company read, replacing the old full
     `itemLedger` GROUP BY that grew with total history. Excludes `Rejected`
     tracked stock (matching `get_inventory_quantities`); the raw scan counted it.
   - **Reads paginate**: every PostgREST read goes through `fetchAll`
     (`@carbon/database/fetch-all`, 1000-row pages + stable `.order()`) —
     production `max_rows = 1000`
     truncates bare `.select("*")` reads, and the dev stack does NOT enforce
     the cap, so truncation is invisible locally.
   - **Writes are atomic**: the Phase-7 delete-and-rewrite of
     `demandForecast`/`demandForecastSource`/`supplyForecast` + actual inserts
     runs in ONE Kysely transaction — a failed run leaves prior planning data
     intact.
   - **Key encoding**: every composite map key goes through `makeKey` /
     `makeLocationItemKey` / `makeActualKey` in `lib/mrp-engine.ts` (joined on
     `KEY_SEP = "\x1f"`). Never build `${a}-${b}` keys — ids are caller-supplied
     TEXT (imports mint hyphenated UUIDs); "-"-joined keys truncated them on
     parse and MRP 500'd for those tenants (Postgres 21000). Regression tests:
     `lib/mrp-engine.test.ts` (deno test).
   - **BOM explosion**: for `Make` items, explodes the active make method to
     derive child demand with low-level-code ordering, per-period inventory
     netting, and lead-time offsetting.
   - **Outputs (DB writes)**: deletes prior MRP forecast rows, then batch-inserts
     (500/chunk) `demandForecast` (`forecastMethod: "mrp"`), `demandForecastSource`
     (lineage), `demandActual`, and `supplyActual`. Writes are stamped with the
     payload `userId` (`"system"` for cron).

## Planning data model (tables — all in newest schema)

Base tables defined in `20250610000433_demand-planning.sql`; lineage table in
`20260527110002_demand-forecast-source.sql`.

| Table | PK | Key cols | Notes |
|-------|----|----|-------|
| `period` | `id` | `startDate`, `endDate`, `periodType` | enum `'Week'\|'Day'\|'Month'`; no companyId (uniform RLS) |
| `demandForecast` | `(itemId, locationId, periodId)` | `forecastQuantity`, `forecastMethod` | MRP writes `forecastMethod='mrp'` |
| `demandActual` | `(itemId, locationId, periodId, sourceType)` | `actualQuantity`, `sourceType` | `sourceType` enum `demandSourceType` = `'Sales Order'\|'Job Material'` |
| `supplyForecast` | `(itemId, locationId, periodId)` | `forecastQuantity`, `forecastMethod` | written by **planning.update** routes (planned POs/jobs), not by MRP |
| `supplyActual` | `(itemId, locationId, periodId, sourceType)` | `actualQuantity`, `sourceType` | `sourceType` enum `supplySourceType` = `'Purchase Order'\|'Production Order'` |
| `demandForecastSource` | surrogate `id` | `sourceType`, `jobId`/`salesOrderLineId`/`demandProjectionId`, `parentItemId`, `quantity` | MRP lineage; enum `demandForecastSourceType` = `'Job Material'\|'Sales Order'\|'Demand Projection'`; CHECK exactly one source id set |

`locationId` is declared `TEXT` (no `NOT NULL`) on all five planning tables, but
it is part of the PRIMARY KEY of every one of them (see the PK column above), so
Postgres makes it **implicitly NOT NULL** — a null `locationId` raises 23502, and
it is also an FK to `location(id)`, so a bogus value (e.g. the empty string
`runMrp` used to write via a `?? ""` key fallback for a source line with no
location) raises 23503 `*_locationId_fkey` and rolls the whole run back. `runMrp`
therefore SKIPS any source line (sales/job-material/production/PO/projection) with
no `locationId` rather than fabricating one. Audit cols (`createdBy/At`,
`updatedBy/At`) present except on `period` and `demandForecastSource`
(created-only).

## Planning split functions

Latest definition: `20260324120000_planning-quantity-to-order.sql` (supersedes the
old `20251205000037_include-reorder-quantity-in-planning.sql`).

- `get_purchasing_planning(company_id, location_id, periods[])` — items where
  `replenishmentSystem != 'Make'` (includes "Buy" and "Buy and Make"),
  `itemTrackingType != 'Non-Inventory'`, `active`.
- `get_production_planning(company_id, location_id, periods[])` — items where
  `replenishmentSystem = 'Make'` (same other filters).
- Both union `supplyActual`+`supplyForecast` and `demandActual`+`demandForecast`,
  project on-hand period-by-period (`week1`…`week52`), and compute `quantityToOrder`
  via `calculate_quantity_to_order(...)`, which branches on `reorderingPolicy`:
  `'Manual Reorder'` → 0; `'Demand-Based Reorder'`; `'Fixed Reorder Quantity'`;
  `'Maximum Quantity'`. All respect min/max OQ, `orderMultiple`, `lotSize`.

## "Buy and Make" coercion + BOM decision

In `mrp-engine.ts`, `effectiveReplenishment()` coerces `"Buy and Make"` → `"Buy"`
before processing, so "Buy and Make" items are never exploded — their demand flows
to purchasing planning. Only `replenishmentSystem = 'Make'` items explode their BOM
to child demand. Note current `methodType` enum is
`'Make to Order' | 'Pull from Inventory' | 'Purchase to Order'`
(NOT the old `'Make'/'Pick'/'Buy'` names).

## Source views (open demand/supply)

Newest defs in `20260417000300_storage-unit-recreate-dependents.sql`
(`openPurchaseOrderLines` in `20260529074512_open-po-lines-required-date.sql`,
`openSalesOrderLines` in `20260710051147_mto-sales-lines-drive-demand.sql`).
All join through `itemReplenishment` to expose `replenishmentSystem`, `leadTime`,
`itemTrackingType`.

- `openSalesOrderLines` — `salesOrderLineType != 'Service'`, status IN
  `('To Ship','To Ship and Invoice')`. Newest def:
  `20260710051147_mto-sales-lines-drive-demand.sql`. Make to Order lines ARE
  included (they were excluded before that migration), but their
  `quantityToSend` is netted down by the remaining output
  (`quantity − quantityReceivedToInventory − quantityShipped`) of live jobs
  linked via `job.salesOrderLineId` (statuses Planned/Ready/In Progress/Paused —
  the same set as `openJobMaterialLines`, so each unit is counted exactly once:
  SO line while unjobbed, job materials once a job is released, inventory once
  produced). Draft/Cancelled jobs do not suppress line demand.
- `openJobMaterialLines` — job status IN `('Planned','Ready','In Progress','Paused')`,
  `methodType != 'Make to Order'`.
- `openProductionOrders` — job status IN those 4, `salesOrderId IS NULL`
  (make-to-stock jobs only); `quantityToReceive = productionQuantity − received`.
- `openPurchaseOrderLines` — `purchaseOrderLineType != 'Service'`, status IN
  `('To Receive','To Receive and Invoice','Planned')`; `dueDate` = requiredDate
  (falls back to receiptPromisedDate).

## Planning UI

- Production: `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/production+/planning.tsx`
  (`view: "production"`) + `ProductionPlanningTable` under
  `apps/erp/app/modules/production/ui/Planning/`.
- Purchasing: `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/purchasing+/planning.tsx`
  (`view: "purchasing"`) + `PurchasingPlanningTable` under
  `apps/erp/app/modules/purchasing/ui/Planning/`.
- Both have a "Recalculate" button (`mrpFetcher.Form` POST to
  `path.to.api.mrp(locationId)`) tooltip: *"MRP runs automatically every 3 hours,
  but you can run it manually here."*
- **Create planned orders** — `planning.update.tsx` in each module:
  - production (`create: "production"`, role `employee`): inserts jobs +
    job methods, upserts `supplyForecast` (`'Production Order'`), then
    `recalculateJobRequirements()`.
  - purchasing (`create: "purchasing"`, role `employee`): inserts purchase
    orders/lines grouped by supplier+period, upserts `supplyForecast`
    (`'Purchase Order'`).

## Gotchas

- The cron is **Inngest**, not Trigger.dev. There is no `apps/erp/app/trigger/mrp.ts`.
  The engine itself is in-process Node (`runMrp` from `@carbon/planning`), NOT
  a Supabase edge function — the `mrp` Deno function was deleted.
- MRP itself writes `demandForecast`/`demandActual`/`supplyActual`/
  `demandForecastSource`; it does **not** write `supplyForecast` — that comes from
  the user-driven `planning.update` routes (planned orders).
- The engine currently runs full MRP regardless of `type`/`id` scope
  (effectively company-wide). <!-- UNVERIFIED: scope-narrowing TODO not re-confirmed in current code -->
- Don't rebuild the DB to test schema; ask the user (per AGENTS.md).
