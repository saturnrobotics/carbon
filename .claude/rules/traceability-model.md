# Traceability / Genealogy Model

Carbon records serial/batch lineage as a **directed graph**:

- **Nodes** = `trackedEntity` rows (a physical serial / batch / lot).
- **Edges** = a `trackedActivity` (an event) plus its `trackedActivityInput` (consumed
  entities) and `trackedActivityOutput` (produced entities) link rows.

Inputs of one activity that are also outputs of an earlier activity form the parent→child
chain. The graph need not be acyclic in storage; traversal RPCs use *strict* filtering to
avoid an entity appearing as its own ancestor/descendant within a single activity.

## Tables (current schema — newest migrations win)

`trackedEntity` (`packages/database/supabase/migrations/20250225145619_tracked-entities.sql`
+ later columns):

| Column | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `id` TEXT | default `nanoid()` (was `xid()` originally, changed in `20250304230616`) |
| `quantity` NUMERIC | serial entities = 1 |
| `status` `trackedEntityStatus` | enum `'Available' \| 'Reserved' \| 'On Hold' \| 'Consumed' \| 'Rejected' \| 'Scrapped'`, default `Available`. `Scrapped` (`20260807090400`) is terminal but **recoverable** via ERP Unscrap (unlike `Consumed`); excluded from on-hand/availability like `Rejected` |
| `sourceDocument` TEXT, `sourceDocumentId` TEXT | polymorphic provenance; for batch/serial/job-seed entities it is `'Item'` + the item id |
| `sourceDocumentReadableId` TEXT | denormalized `item.readableIdWithRevision`; kept in sync by an `item` AFTER-UPDATE interceptor `sync_propagate_item_readable_id_to_tracked_entity` (`20260428100000`) |
| `readableId` TEXT | the serial OR batch number (promoted out of `attributes` in `20251220013724`/`20251220021403`) |
| `itemId` TEXT | **FK to `item(id)` `ON DELETE RESTRICT`** (`20260426000000`). Nullable today; an item with any tracked entity (even `Consumed`) cannot be hard-deleted — deactivate instead |
| `expirationDate` DATE | first-class column (`20260426020000`), drives FEFO + near-expiry reports. NOT stored in `attributes` |
| `attributes` JSONB | descriptive only: `Receipt Line`, `Receipt`, `Supplier`, `Job`, `Job Make Method`, `Job Material`, etc. (GIN-indexed) |
| `companyId`, `createdAt`, `createdBy` | standard |

`trackedActivity`: `id`, `type` TEXT (e.g. `'Picking'`, production, receipt…),
`sourceDocument`/`sourceDocumentId`/`sourceDocumentReadableId` (nullable), `attributes` JSONB.

`trackedActivityInput` / `trackedActivityOutput`: PK `(trackedActivityId, trackedEntityId)`,
`quantity` NUMERIC, `companyId`, `createdAt`, `createdBy`. Both FK to activity and entity
`ON DELETE CASCADE`.
**Gotcha:** the old `trackedActivityInput.entityType` column was **dropped** in
`20250301125444` — it does not exist.

RLS: SELECT/INSERT gated on `get_companies_with_employee_role()`; UPDATE/DELETE require
`inventory_update` / `inventory_delete` permissions (`20260327171223`).

## How entities are created

- **Receipt** (batch/serial): DB functions `update_receipt_line_batch_tracking` /
  `update_receipt_line_serial_tracking` insert with `status='On Hold'`, fill `readableId`,
  `itemId`, and resolve `expirationDate` (caller-supplied or `resolve_shelf_life_start_for_receipt`).
- **Job seed entities**: `item` event-trigger handlers `sync_insert_job_make_method`,
  `sync_insert_job_material_make_method`, `sync_update_job_material_make_method_item_id`
  create `status='Reserved'` entities tagged with `Job` / `Job Make Method` / `Job Material`.
- `jobMakeMethod.trackedEntityId` plus `requiresSerialTracking` / `requiresBatchTracking`
  flags (derived from `item.itemTrackingType` = `'Serial'`/`'Batch'`) drive whether a job
  step demands tracking.

## How genealogy edges are written

Edges are created in **Supabase edge functions** (`packages/database/supabase/functions/`)
and MES services — NOT a single `post-production`:

- `post-picking`, `post-receipt`, `post-shipment`, `post-stock-transfer`, `issue`,
  `trigger-rework` insert `trackedActivity` + input/output link rows on posting.
- MES `startProductionEvent` (`apps/mes/app/services/operations.service.ts`) inserts a
  `trackedActivity` and a `trackedActivityOutput` for the production event.
- **Scrap** (`.ai/specs/2026-08-06-scrap-unscrap-flow.md`): `issue` case
  `jobOperationScrap` scraps the serial being made — `type: 'Scrap'` activity,
  entity → `Scrapped`, then **spawns the next serial** (same `getNextSerialNumbers`
  path as `jobOperationSerialComplete`) and reopens the make method's Done ops
  (`issue/scrap-replacement.ts`) so the replacement runs the full routing. `issue`
  case `scrapTrackedEntity` scraps a subcomponent, branching on entity **state**:
  an `Available` part posts a `Scrap` (`Negative Adjmt.`) `itemLedger` at its
  on-hand bin (`quantityIssued` untouched); a `Consumed` part posts Dr scrap /
  Cr WIP at the item's unit cost and **decrements `quantityIssued`** to reopen
  the requirement. Make-to-Order can additionally spawn a replacement + `rework`
  row (`makeReplacement`). ERP stock **Scrap/Unscrap** run through
  `post-inventory-adjustment` (`type: 'Unscrap'` activity restores a `Scrapped`
  entity at the original scrapped cost via `correctionOfItemLedgerId`). Every scrap
  journal is offset to `accountDefault.scrapAccount` and tagged with ScrapReason /
  WorkCenter / Employee `journalLineDimension` rows.

Pattern: insert `trackedActivity`, then `trackedActivityInput` for each consumed entity and
`trackedActivityOutput` for each produced entity; post `itemLedger` rows
(`itemLedger.trackedEntityId` FK, `ON DELETE SET NULL`) for the inventory movement.

## How lineage is queried

Per-entity strict RPCs (`20251231172218`, returns `readableId`):
`get_direct_ancestors_of_tracked_entity_strict(p_tracked_entity_id)` (backward / "where from") and
`get_direct_descendants_of_tracked_entity_strict(p_tracked_entity_id)` (forward / "where to").
Non-strict variants exist but include same-activity siblings — prefer strict.

**Batch variants** (`20260430090114`, take a `TEXT[]`, add a `sourceEntityId` output column):
`get_direct_ancestors_of_tracked_entities_strict` / `get_direct_descendants_of_tracked_entities_strict`
— one round-trip per BFS frontier instead of per node. The ERP graph view uses these.

- Graph route: `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/traceability+/graph.tsx` → calls
  `fetchLineageSubgraph` / `fetchJobScopedLineage` in
  `apps/erp/app/modules/inventory/lineage.server.ts` (BFS over the batch RPCs).
- Graph types `GraphNode` / `GraphLink` / `GraphData` live in
  `apps/erp/app/modules/inventory/types.ts` (link `type` is `"input" | "output"`).
- ERP service `inventory.service.ts`: `getTrackedEntities`, `getTrackedEntity`,
  `getTrackedEntitiesByMakeMethodId`, `getTrackedEntitiesByOperationId`,
  `updateTrackedEntityExpiry`, `getTrackedEntityExpirations`.
- MES `operations.service.ts`: `getTrackedEntity`, `getTrackedEntitiesByMakeMethodId`,
  `getTrackedInputs` (wraps the strict RPCs; **filters out `Scrapped` descendants** so a
  scrapped subcomponent no longer appears in the issue modal's Unconsume/Scrap lists — the
  scrap already relieved its WIP and reopened the requirement; the lineage graph still shows
  it), `startProductionEvent`.

**Serial sibling clustering (display only).** A serial item at qty N produces N
qty-1 entities by design, so one job fans out into N identical nodes. The graph
collapses siblings that share an identical **edge signature** — the exact set of
`(activityId, side)` pairs — plus the same item and `status`, into one
`entityGroup` node (`ui/Traceability/cluster.ts` → `clusterEntities`, called from
`payloadToFlow` in `ui/Traceability/utils.ts`, whose only caller is the worker's
`computeFullLayout`). Guards: the traced root never clusters, `quantity !== 1`
never clusters (protects post-flip batch fragments), the entity must resolve to a
SINGLE timeline state (a bin-transferred serial replays to two and stays
individual), and a group needs ≥ 3 members. One edge per signature entry with the
members' quantities summed. Members are reached only through the sidebar's list —
cluster nodes carry no expand toggles, since expanding a 50-member group would
fetch 50 lineages. Clusters travel from the graph to the sidebar (its sibling in
the route) through `ui/Traceability/store.ts`. Because clustering absorbs serial
fans, `MAX_ENTITIES` in `lineage.server.ts` is **500**; the BFS must stay complete
up to it, since a truncated frontier would split a group in two.

## Picking / availability (shelf → storageUnit rename)

`get_available_tracked_entities(...)` (`20260614171204`) and
`get_picking_list_tracked_available(...)` (`20260617142853`) list `status='Available'`
entities for picking. These return **`storageUnitId` / `storageUnitName`** (`storageUnit`
table) — the modern naming after the `shelf` → `storageUnit` rename. They net out
`pickingListLineTrackedEntity` allocations, drop lineside (work-center) bins, and order by
FEFO (`expirationDate ASC NULLS LAST`) then FIFO (`createdAt ASC`). Powers the shared
`packages/react/src/TrackedEntityPicker.tsx`. `get_available_tracked_entities` also
takes `p_sort_method` (`Default|FEFO|FIFO|LIFO`) — but its internal `ORDER BY` is not
guaranteed through PostgREST (SQL-function inlining), so callers that need a specific
order sort in the app (MES `sortLotsByPickMethod` in `apps/mes/app/services/allocation.ts`).

**Split identity convention (batch only; spec `.ai/specs/2026-08-04-batch-split-identity-flip.md`):**
on a partial batch draw of quantity `q` from `parent`, the **shelf/source entity KEEPS its id**
and is decremented by `q`; a **NEW `child` entity** (same `readableId`, attributes cloned +
`"Split From Entity ID": parent.id`) holds `q` and is what departs (lineside / other bin /
consumed / shipped). The Split activity records input `parent`@`q` → output `child`@`q` (no
survivor self-loop), and the ledger gets exactly **two** net-zero `Batch Split` rows
(−`q` parent, +`q` child) at the parent's `resolveTrackedEntityBin` bin. The legacy pre-flip
convention (original departs, `"Split Entity ID"` tagged on the survivor) still exists on
historical rows — filters that isolate the live root entity exclude BOTH pointer keys. The
shared record builder is `functions/shared/batch-split.ts` (`buildBatchSplitRecords` /
`buildMergeRecords`), used by every writer: `post-picking` (batch), `issue`
(`trackedEntitiesToOperation` + `maintenanceDispatchTrackedEntities`), `post-stock-transfer`
(batch), `post-shipment` (SO + PO — PO posts genealogy only, no ledger), and ERP
`quality-disposition.subdivideBatchEntity`. Serial paths never split. Exception: the
PO-sourced `post-shipment` split posts no `itemLedger` (matches pre-flip behavior).

**Lot merge (the deliberate inverse; spec `.ai/specs/2026-09-16-batch-materials-and-output-lots.md`):**
`issue` case `mergeTrackedEntities` combines N **same-item, Available** entities into ONE
new entity via `buildBatchMergeRecords` (`functions/shared/batch-merge.ts`, the mirror of
`buildBatchSplitRecords`). Parents keep their quantity as a historical record and flip
`Consumed`; the merged entity gets a fresh id, the SUMMED quantity, the **earliest** parent
`expirationDate`, and only those `attributes` every parent agrees on, plus
`"Merged From Entity IDs"` provenance. It inherits the FIRST parent's `readableId` when the
caller supplies none — an `Available` lot with a NULL batch number is unidentifiable on the
floor (the split child inherits `parent.readableId` for the same reason), so callers that
care about which number wins must pass the parents in their intended order. Genealogy is one
`trackedActivity` `type: 'Merge'` with an input edge per parent (at its quantity) and one
output edge for the merged entity; the ledger gets net-zero `Batch Merge` rows (−q at each
parent's `resolveTrackedEntityBin`, +Σq at the first parent's). Distinct from
`buildMergeRecords` in `batch-split.ts`, which is the **merge-on-return** of a split child
back into its own parent — same activity type, different operation. Reached from the MES
batch-completion prompt and the ERP batch drawer's "Merge output lots"; both derive the
parent ids server-side from the batch's membership (see `mes-job-operation-ui.md`).

**Pick → consume → return lifecycle (batch/serial):** a **pick** (`post-picking`) is an
`itemLedger` Transfer warehouse→lineside (the departing lineside lot is the split CHILD, and
`pickingListLineTrackedEntity` records the CHILD id); **consumption** (`issue`
`trackedEntitiesToOperation`) posts a negative Consumption row and, on partial use, **splits**
the entity — the CONSUMED portion becomes the NEW `child` (`status: 'Consumed'`), the survivor
keeps its id at lineside. Consumption/split rows are booked against the entity's actual on-hand
bin (`resolveTrackedEntityBin`), not an arbitrary ledger row. The **return** of the un-consumed
remainder runs via `post-picking`'s sweep cases `returnJobRemainders` (at job complete — both
policies) / `returnOperationRemainders` (at operation Done, only when
`companySettings.returnPickedMaterialTiming = 'operation'`): the tracked path walks the picked
entity's split lineage and, for each lineage entity with lineside on-hand, **merges** it back
into its `"Split From Entity ID"` parent when the parent is Available/same-lot/same-bin (a
`type: 'Merge'` activity + net Transfer), else transfers it back as a standalone lot. It
decrements the `pickingListLineTrackedEntity` allocation but books the line-level return on
**`pickingListLine.quantityReturned`** (NOT decrementing `quantityPicked` — that would fire
`update_picking_list_status` and demote a Completed/Partial header). Untracked materials return
per jobMaterial:
`max(0, Σ(picked − returned) − max(quantityIssued, owed))`, newest-line-first — never a bin
sweep (the lineside bin is shared per work center). Spec:
`.ai/specs/2026-08-04-picked-material-return-timing.md`.

## Quantity integrity — the four invariants

`trackedEntity.quantity` is a bare NUMERIC (no declared scale, per the DB
conventions), so whatever float a writer hands it is what gets stored. A lot
left holding `0.020000000000000018` after an earlier split reads "0.02" in every
UI and behaves like 0.02 nowhere. Four rules follow, and they are shared code
rather than convention because inlining them is how they drifted apart.

**1. Round at the persist boundary.** Every write that moves a quantity rounds
at internal scale (`round` from `functions/shared/precision.ts`, re-exported
through `@carbon/utils` for Node). The whole settle is
`settleQuantity({ quantity, status, refusal? })` in
`functions/shared/entity-drain.ts` — round, refuse a negative result, then apply
rule 2 — and it takes the SETTLED figure, not a delta, so one signature serves
the count path (snapshot delta) and the adjustment/unpick paths alike.
`resolveCountedEntity` (post-inventory-count) is a thin wrapper that supplies
its own recount message. Callers: `post-inventory-adjustment` (three drain
paths), `post-inventory-count`, `create` (receipt split), `post-picking`
(unpick child).

**2. A drained lot is Consumed, not a husk.** `statusAfterQuantityChange`
(same file) flips a lot that rounds to zero to `Consumed` — but a `Scrapped`
lot stays `Scrapped` at zero, because it is a historical record and Unscrap is
the only way back. **`Rejected` is NOT preserved today**; it is the other
quality marker excluded from on-hand, and `correct-stock-movement` (which
excludes only `Consumed`) can drive one to zero. Whether it should be preserved
is an open question, not an oversight — see
`.ai/plans/2026-09-22-tracked-entity-quantity-integrity.md`.

**3. One split gate.** `isFullDraw(entityQuantity, drawQuantity)` in
`functions/shared/batch-split.ts` (`equals` on both rounded values) is how every
writer decides split-or-take-whole, so a caller's decision and
`buildBatchSplitRecords`' own refusals (`draw <= 0`, `draw >= parentQty`) can
never disagree. A raw `===`/`<` on two stored floats can: a residue lot drawn for its
own 0.02 read as PARTIAL, and the builder then threw `draw >= parentQty` as a
500 on what the operator saw as a legitimate full pick — or minted a child
entity holding 1.8e-17. Callers: `issue` (both children loops), `post-picking`,
`post-stock-transfer`, `post-shipment` (all three split decisions, including an
ad-hoc `draw + 0.00001 >= entityQty` epsilon that predated the helper),
`post-inventory-adjustment` (partial scrap). A full draw also books the LOT's
own rounded quantity, not the requested figure — the entity is flipped
`Consumed` without its quantity being rewritten, so the ledger row has to agree
with the lot it just emptied.

**4. A pick accumulates under a lock.** `resolvePick` in
`functions/shared/pick-guards.ts` returns the NEW running total (never a
replacement) or throws a typed `PickGuardError` — `already-picked`,
`over-pick`, or `empty-pick` (a quantity that rounds to zero). The caller turns
it into a **400**, never a 500, and both apps read the reason out of the
response BODY (`getEdgeFunctionErrorMessage` in the ERP,
`getPostPickingErrorMessage` in MES) because supabase-js's own
`FunctionsHttpError.message` is always the fixed "Edge Function returned a
non-2xx status code". It is only correct under a row lock: `post-picking` locks
the `pickingListLine` in every handler and the source lot in the batch pick,
`post-stock-transfer` locks the line plus the entity (and, in the serial case,
the entity BEFORE its repeat-scan guard — two concurrent scans would otherwise
both read "not on this transfer" and both post a Transfer pair).
`resolveStockTransferPickForward` (`inventory.models.ts`) is the route-side
pre-check that mirrors the same rounding so the two cannot disagree; the lock
is what makes the edge function authoritative.

**The drain rule is not only a TypeScript concern.** `update_receipt_line_batch_tracking`
upserted a receipt lot with `ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE SET "quantity" = EXCLUDED."quantity"`
and never touched `status`, so editing a batch line down to 0 on a receipt whose lot
had already gone Available left `0` + `Available` — the exact husk this rule forbids
(fixed in `20260923220000_receipt-batch-tracking-settle-status.sql`, which drains to
`Consumed` and revives a re-entered quantity to `On Hold`). Neither `settleQuantity`
nor the `no-unrounded-tracked-quantity` check could see it: the check scans TypeScript
only. The net that DOES cover SQL functions and triggers is the data-driven invariant
`packages/checks/src/invariants/tracked-entity-zero-available.sql` — run it after
touching any tracked-entity writer, in either language. The serial twin
(`update_receipt_line_serial_tracking`) is unaffected: it always inserts quantity 1 and
its UPDATE branch never writes quantity.

The DB backstop is `trackedEntity_quantity_nonnegative`
(`20260922191138_tracked-entity-quantity-nonnegative.sql`), a CHECK added
**`NOT VALID`** so existing negative prod rows would not fail the deploy — so it
guards new and updated rows only until a later migration `VALIDATE`s it. The
static backstop is the `no-unrounded-tracked-quantity` conformance rule in
`@carbon/checks`, which flags inline unrounded arithmetic in a
`.updateTable("trackedEntity")` quantity set and a raw compare against a
quantity read straight off a row. It has no baseline entries.

**Gotcha:** the older `get_item_quantities_by_tracking_id` (`20260101163400`) still emits
legacy `shelfId` / `shelfName` and joins the `shelf` table — both column sets exist; check
which RPC you are calling.
