  Reference/entity pages, the docs IA, or "document this feature" requests — anything destined for
  the docs site. Covers the grounded-in-source authoring workflow, the flow-based Guide architecture,
  the real MDX components for each surface, the warm-paper house style, and the build verification
  loop. Trigger even if the user doesn't say "docs" but clearly wants explanatory, reader-facing

# Carbon Docs

`docs` is a **built, opinionated** documentation site — Fumadocs + Next.js (React 19), **light-only**,
warm-paper aesthetic. It is no longer scaffolded; it exists and ships content. This skill is how to add
or change docs **in that system, in its house style, grounded in real Carbon code.**

**Announce at start:** "Using the carbon-docs skill — authoring docs for {topic}."

## First: ask which kind of page this is

Not all doc pages are equal — a settings toggle does not get the treatment a production flow gets, and
the single biggest quality failure so far has been writing every page in the long narrative register.
**Before any research or writing, ask the user to pick the page type** (AskUserQuestion, one question,
your recommended type first — infer it from the topic). Skip the question only when the user already
named the type in their request, or you're editing an existing page without changing its shape (keep
its current type). Several pages in one request → one question covering them.

| Type | Reader's question | Shape | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Flow / tour** (Guide) | "walk me through it" | Narrative chapter in a flow: sequenced, illustrated, second-person storytelling, prior stages set up | length serves the story |
| **System / entity** (Reference) | "how does it work — fields, statuses, rules?" | 1–2 lead sentences → `<StatusFlow entity=…>` lifecycle → rule/gotcha Callouts → `<FieldTable>` → `<Cards>` onward | ~800–1,500 words |
| **Settings / how-to** (Reference) | "how do I turn it on / use it?" | 1–2 lead sentences → `<Steps>` → one gotcha Callout → where-it-lives | ~300–600 words; steps, not story |
| **Concept / overview** (Reference) | "what is this area?" | Short intro + `<Cards>` linking to the owning pages | ~150–300 words |

A page can mix types **by section** (an entity page that ends with a short settings section) — pick the
dominant type for the page, then hold each section to its own shape. Troubleshooting/FAQ content never
gets a reader-visible section: it goes in `<AgentContext>` (see Reference components).

**No page ends cold.** Every page closes pointing onward: entity and concept pages with a small
`<Cards>` Related row, settings pages with where-it-lives links, guide chapters get "read next" for
free. A page that just stops is an IA bug, not a style choice.

The house voice below scales with this choice: full narrative register belongs to Guides; entity pages
dial it down to scannable-with-gotchas; settings/how-to pages drop it entirely. On a settings page the
reader wants the steps, not an essay — two-factor auth is a 500-word how-to, not an 1,800-word
meditation on passwords.

> The single biggest mistake is writing plausible ERP-generic prose. Carbon's behavior is specific and
> often counterintuitive (WIP is a GL balance not a table; a payment is a posted entity applied via
> settlements; overhead IS absorbed into WIP per production event; fixed-asset disposal is
> scrapping-only). **Every claim is grounded in source.** See the
> prime directive below — it overrides everything.

> **What Carbon is:** a manufacturing system — **ERP** (the office) + **MES** (the floor), one platform over
> one data model. **Academy is *not* a third product pillar**: it just hosts training **video lessons**, not a
> SaaS app a customer buys. Never frame Carbon as "ERP, MES, and training/Academy"; site, meta, and landing
> copy stay **ERP + MES**. (The `academy` app can appear in an architecture/monorepo listing — fine; describe
> it as video-lesson hosting, not a pillar.)

## The prime directive — ground everything in source

The **holy source of truth is the actual source code + the LATEST database migrations**
(`packages/database/supabase/migrations/`, newest by timestamp) — NOT ERP/CMMS general knowledge, NOT
`.claude/rules/` alone (it is often stale).

- **Verify before you write.** Every entity, status enum *value*, and transition named in docs must exist
  in real code. Confirm exact strings (`"To Ship and Invoice"`, `"Fully Depreciated"`), the actions that
  drive them (service fns, routes, edge functions in `packages/database/supabase/functions/`), and what
  posts/gates (e.g. `companySettings.accountingEnabled`).
- **Read the newest migration, not the first.** Timestamps order them; a 2026 refactor may have rebuilt a
  subsystem the cache still describes the old way.
- **Document only real, ACTIVE features.** Omit placeholders / inactive / not-yet-shipped things (e.g.
  integration registry entries with `active: false` like QuickBooks/Sage). Don't surface them.
- **Deliberately undocumented:** the **Implementation Hub** (`/x/get-started`, `packages/onboarding`
  content) stays out of the docs by the user's decision — don't document it, and don't link to it.
- **When code and cache disagree, code wins** — and note the drift.
- **Method:** one research subagent per feature → a structured **fact sheet** with `file:line` refs
  (contract in Authoring workflow step 1) → then write from it. This is how every flow in the Guide was
  built. Don't skip it for anything non-trivial.

## Three surfaces (know which you're touching)

| Surface | Path / route | What it is | Authored? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Guides** | `content/guides/*.mdx` → `/guides` | Editorial narrative *tours*, grouped into **flows**. Second-person, opinionated, illustrated. The journey + the "why". | Hand-written MDX |
| **Reference** | `content/docs/**/*.mdx` → `/docs` | One page per entity/concept. Scannable: tables, cards, field rows. The "what". | Hand-written MDX |
| **API reference** | `app/api-reference/[module]/[resource]` | PostgREST endpoint docs, **generated at build** from the swagger. | **Generated — do NOT hand-edit.** Edit `scripts/generate-api-docs.mjs` or the swagger schema. |

Interlink across surfaces and flows: a Guide links into Reference for detail; Reference links back to the
Guide for the story. (Guide chapters were given 12 cross-flow links — interlinking is expected, not optional.)

## Authoring workflow (every change)

1. **Research (grounded) → a fact sheet.** Dispatch a research subagent per feature. It must return a
   structured **fact sheet**, not prose: entities/tables/columns; exact status strings and which entity
   owns each; transitions with the action that drives them (service fn / route / edge function) as
   `file:line`; gates and settings (`companySettings.*`, plan features); the real UI labels for every
   where-to-click; the gotchas a generic description would get wrong; and an explicit "could not verify"
   list — a gap on that list is more research work, never a writing improvisation. The writer then works
   ONLY from the fact sheet + the page-type template, and writing stays in the main loop on the main
   model — no model downgrades for prose; the fact sheet is the handoff, not a license for a weaker
   writer.
2. **Pick the surface + placement** (the page *type* was chosen up front). Guide flow + frontmatter, or
   Reference folder + `meta.json` + `REFERENCE_GROUPS` — run the placement checklist below before
   creating any new page.
3. **Write in the house voice** with the surface's real components (below). Lead with a concrete example.
   **Decide media placement yourself as you write — don't wait to be asked.** Drop a `<Screenshot>` slot
   wherever the reader needs to see the actual UI, with a label naming the real screen + state (the fact
   sheet's UI labels are the source); use `<Figure>` only when a registry key genuinely fits. Typical
   density by page type: settings/how-to 1 (the screen with the switch/steps), entity 1–2 (the list or
   detail view, or the lifecycle UI), guide chapters one per major beat, concept stubs none. **Boy Scout
   rule:** editing an existing Reference page that has no `<Screenshot>`? Add the one slot its type calls
   for while you're there — the Reference surface shipped with almost none, and it goes on the media
   manifest like any new slot. Reuse existing slots on a rewrite; never drop or re-label one that a real
   capture may already exist for. Slot `label`s double as the image's alt text once a capture lands, so
   write them as a description of what's *shown* (screen + state), never as a caption or a filename.
4. **Verify — against the user's running dev server, read-only.** They usually have `pnpm --filter docs dev`
   up. **Never** `pkill`/restart it, run `next build`, or `rm .next` under it — verify by fetching pages:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   pnpm exec fumadocs-mdx                 # regen .source if a content/frontmatter change didn't HMR
   curl -sS -X GET http://localhost:3002/docs/<slug> | grep -o "your new heading"   # confirm it rendered
   ```
   A green `pnpm --filter docs build` (`✓ Generating static pages N/N`) is the gold standard — but only in a
   clean checkout / when no dev server is running. `tsc` is noisy (a React 18/19 `@types` skew that
   `next.config` ignores) — grep your own files out of the errors rather than expecting zero.

## Guides — the flow architecture

Frontmatter (`source.config.ts` schema):

```yaml
---
title: From quote to order
description: An RFQ becomes a quote; an accepted quote becomes a sales order.
label: "(I)"          # display marker, roman numeral, per-flow
index: 0              # order WITHIN the flow (0,1,2…)
flow: quote-to-cash   # flow id (omit → defaults to "make-to-order")
flowName: Quote to cash   # flow tab label
flowIndex: 1          # order of the flow in the subnav (0 = first)
---
```

- Chapters sort by `(flowIndex, index)`. The **subnav is a flow switcher**; the **sidebar + mobile selector
  + "read next" are scoped to the active flow**. The original 5 chapters (order/build/plan/floor/ship) carry
  no flow fields and fold into `make-to-order` (flowIndex 0) via defaults.
- **Add a chapter to a flow:** same `flow`/`flowName`/`flowIndex`, next `index` + `label`.
- **Add a flow:** new `flowIndex` + `flowName`; its chapters start at `index: 0`, `label: "(I)"`.
- All chapter bodies render server-side on every page (the reader cross-fades, no route nav), so links to
  `/guides/<slug>` resolve. **No code fences in guides** (prose + components only).

**Components** (`components/editorial/mdx.tsx`):

- `<Figure illustration="flow-overview" caption="…" />` — SVG from the registry. **`illustration` MUST be a
  real key** from `components/editorial/illustrations.tsx` (else it silently renders nothing). Valid keys:
  `flow-overview, order-split, bom-tree, demand-forecast, planning-engine, shopfloor-loop, eight-d,
  traceability-graph, method-types, kit-vs-subassembly, reorder-policy, outside-processing, mes-station,
  issue-workflow, schedule-board, get-method, conversion-factor, opportunity-thread, cash-cycle,
  rfq-fanout, receive-bill-axes, wip-inflow, wip-to-cogs, depreciation-curve, asset-exit`. For anything
  without a fitting key, use `<Screenshot>` instead — don't invent keys.
- `<Screenshot label="Sales order dashboard" caption="…" ratio="wide|tall|square" />` — a standing **slot for
  a real Carbon capture**. Use it where the reader needs to see the actual UI (dashboard, a specific
  form/field, status, board, where-to-click) — not as decoration. Label the **real, current** screen + state
  precisely (verify it exists) so a real screenshot can drop straight in and the docs stay synced to the live
  Carbon UI. Default `ratio="wide"`.
- `<Callout tone="neutral|blue|green|amber" badge="WHY BATCH" title="…">body</Callout>` — the workhorse.
  Use it to carry the **Carbon-specific truth a generic description gets wrong**. Tones: blue = explanatory
  "why", green = good-to-know/outcome, amber = caution/contrast, neutral = definitional.
- `<Divider />` — closes a chapter before its wrap-up line.
- `<Term>make to order</Term>` — inline glossary term: dotted-underline; click/tap opens a popover with a
  grounded one-line definition + an optional "Learn more" link. Same component on both surfaces; definitions
  live in `@carbon/glossary` (`packages/glossary/src/terms.ts`), rendered by
  `docs/components/editorial/glossary.tsx`. See "Interlinking & the glossary" below.

Each `##` heading becomes a sidebar rail entry — so structure chapters as 3–5 `##` sections.

## Reference — entity pages

- Frontmatter: `title` + `description` (+ `plan` for a paid-feature gate).
- **Placement checklist — run it BEFORE creating any page.** (1) Does an existing page already own this
  topic? Grep `content/docs` for the feature name; if a page covers it, **extend that page** with a
  section instead of creating a parallel one — a bucket page that re-documents features owned elsewhere
  is scattering, not architecture. (2) One noun per page. (3) If genuinely new: which sidebar group does
  it belong to (`REFERENCE_GROUPS`, next bullet)? If none fits, propose a group to the user rather than
  letting the page dangle ungrouped. (4) **Sub-folders are exceptional** — one entity = one page;
  `change-orders/` is the only folder today, and splitting a feature across a new folder needs the
  user's sign-off first.
- **Nav is TWO layers — miss the second and your page dangles at the bottom of the sidebar.** Folders:
  `content/docs/{reference,platform,building,integrations}/`. A folder's `meta.json` `pages` array is
  authoritative for membership AND order (top-level section order is the root `meta.json`) — and the flat
  Product-reference list is additionally nested into sidebar groups by the hardcoded `REFERENCE_GROUPS`
  slug map in `app/docs/layout.tsx`, whose group order and within-group slug order are what the reader
  sees. A reference page missing from that map is appended **ungrouped** after the groups. So adding a
  reference page = slug into `reference/meta.json` **and** into the right `REFERENCE_GROUPS` group.
  **Don't list `index` in `pages`** — fumadocs treats `index.mdx` as the folder index
  and the nav renders it as **"Overview"**; listing it duplicates the title as a sibling. Integrations are
  their own top-level section (`content/docs/integrations/`) grouped by category — document only `active`
  integrations (omit `active: false` placeholders + commented-out ones).
- **Components** (`components/editorial/reference-components.tsx` + `components/mdx.tsx`):
  - `<Callout type="info|note|warn|warning|error|success|tip" title?>…</Callout>` — type → badge+tone
    (`info/note`→NOTE/blue, `warn/warning/error`→HEADS UP/amber, `success/tip`→GOOD TO KNOW/green). Note this
    is a **different Callout API** than the Guides one (type vs tone+badge).
  - `<Cards><Card title href icon?>…</Card></Cards>` — link-card grid (cross-surface navigation).
  - `<EnvVars><EnvVar name type? default? required?>…</EnvVar></EnvVars>` — field/parameter rows. The env-var
    page uses these; for an entity's **field reference** prefer `<FieldTable>` (below).
  - `<FieldTable><Field name type? required?>desc</Field></FieldTable>`
    (`components/editorial/field-table.tsx`) — the accordion field/parameter reference, the warm-paper take on
    Fumadocs' TypeTable. Use it for a `| Field | Type | Description |`-shaped table (item/job/line fields,
    routing, work-center, reorder/shelf-life policy fields, integration settings). `type` = the type token
    (omit when the table has no type column); `required` only when the source marks it so; the child is the
    description as **MDX** (so inline `` `code` ``, *italics*, `<Term>` render — that's why it's children, not a
    `type={{}}` prop). Registered in **both** `mdx.tsx` and `editorial/mdx.tsx`.
  - `<StatusFlow entity="job"><Status name accent? branch? terminal?>meaning</Status></StatusFlow>`
    (`components/editorial/status-flow.tsx`) — an **interactive** lifecycle widget (selectable pills → a detail
    `Callout` showing the meaning) that replaces a linear `| Status | Meaning |` table. Children in source
    (lifecycle) order; meanings are MDX. Flags: `accent` = the single pivotal milestone (≤1, optional);
    `branch` = a temporary returnable hold (Paused, On Hold, Needs Approval); `terminal` = an off-path exit
    (Cancelled, Voided, Lost, Expired). **`entity` is REQUIRED in practice**: it resolves each status's
    real ERP badge color from `@carbon/utils/status-colors` (`statusColorMaps`); omit it and every pill
    silently renders gray — that is a bug, not a style. If the entity has no map yet, add one to
    `packages/utils/src/status-colors.ts`, **derived from the module's `*Status.tsx` component in the
    ERP** (never guessed), then pass it. Use it ONLY for a **linear** lifecycle — a 2-axis comparison matrix
    (e.g. invoices sales-vs-purchase) or a small enum list stays a markdown table.
  - `<AgentContext>…</AgentContext>` — renders **nothing** on the site; its content ships only to the
    in-app agent's knowledge base (`pnpm run generate:agent-kb` → `apps/erp/app/modules/agent/kb/`,
    regenerated automatically by check-and-commit). Put troubleshooting/FAQ, exact error strings, and
    internal mechanics (table names, routes, enum internals) here — reader-facing prose stays free of
    them. Never write a reader-visible "Troubleshooting" section. About half the Reference pages still
    have no `<AgentContext>`: when your fact sheet surfaced exact error strings for a page you're
    editing, seed or extend its block while you're there.
  - `<PlanBadge plan="Business" />` — flags a paid feature. Whole-page gate → set `plan: Business` in
    frontmatter; renders a small **"Paid"** pill inline with the page title (label is fixed to "Paid"; the
    `plan` value only feeds the hover tooltip + the banner copy). Section gate → drop `<PlanBadge>` in-body.
    Gated features = `packages/ee/src/plan.ts`. **Don't** badge free ones (email, exchange-rates).
  - **Plan-gated pages also get a full-width announcement bar** (`components/plan-banner-bar.tsx`,
    `PlanBannerBar`) rendered by the docs **layout** (`app/docs/[[...slug]]/layout` builds a url→plan map from
    `plan` frontmatter and passes it in) — sticky under the header, spanning the content area. Adding
    `plan: Business` frontmatter is all it takes; the badge and the bar both light up. Don't hand-place a
    banner in MDX.
  - **Licensing model — get this right, it's been wrong before.** See `docs/content/docs/platform/licensing.mdx`
    (the canonical page). Editions (`packages/utils/src/types.ts` `enum Edition`): **Community** (self-host,
    AGPLv3 open core), **Enterprise** (self-host + commercial license), **Cloud** (managed). EE features =
    code under `packages/ee` or any `.ee` file → require a commercial license per the repo `LICENSE`.
    - **Carbon Cloud = the hosted SaaS at https://app.carbon.ms** — NOT the `/docs/platform/...` deployment
      docs. Self-hosting recipes (Docker with Caddy, AWS with SST) live under
      `docs/content/docs/platform/self-hosting/`.
    - **Cloud plans = Starter and Business only.** `Plan` enum also has `Partner`, but Partner is
      **internal-only — never mention it in reader-facing docs.** Don't write "Business and Partner plans".
    - **Never write "self-hosted isn't plan-gated."** The *runtime* gate is Cloud-only
      (`packages/ee/src/plan.server.ts` returns early when `CarbonEdition !== Edition.Cloud`), but the
      *license* still governs: self-hosting runs in **community mode**; Enterprise/EE features need a
      commercial license. Frame it as a license boundary, not a technical lockout — features aren't
      "disabled" in Community.
  - `<Steps>/<Step>`, `<Tabs>/<Tab>` (fumadocs-ui), markdown tables, and code fences (dark panel).
  - `<Term id?>…</Term>` — inline glossary term (dotted underline → definition popover). The same component
    as the Guide; see "Interlinking & the glossary" below.
- Voice is more technical/scannable than the Guides — fields, constraints, tables — but still names the
  gotcha and links back to the Guide for the narrative.

## House voice

Calibrated by the page type chosen up front: Guides get the full register below; entity pages keep the
grounding and the gotchas but stay scannable; settings/how-to pages take only "quote real names exactly"
and "ground every where-to-click" — no narrative, no rhetorical asides, no answering questions nobody
asked. Cutting to budget beats compressing: drop whole asides, don't shorten every sentence.

- **Active voice, second person, one term per concept.** Never alternate synonyms for the same thing
  ("API key" one paragraph, "API token" the next) — the glossary term is the term, everywhere. No
  colloquialisms or idioms; the catalogs are translated and idioms don't survive it.
- **Never state the obvious.** "Click Save to save" documents nothing. A step earns its place by
  carrying something the button label doesn't already say.
- **Every page stands alone.** A reader (or an AI retriever) lands cold from search: state the context
  and prerequisites in place rather than leaning on the previous page. How-to/settings pages name their
  prerequisites explicitly before the steps ("needs `settings` update permission", "requires the Slack
  integration connected").
- **Second person, concrete, narrative.** Anchor in the running example (the 90-unit humanoid-robot order).
  "Open the sales order dashboard." / "You don't build 90 robots as one monolithic job."
- **Quote real status names exactly**, in quotes: `**"To Ship and Invoice"**`, `**"Posted"**`, `**"Open"**`.
  Status strings live on a specific entity — confirm whether a value belongs to the *header* or the *line*
  (e.g. `"To Ship and Invoice"`/`"To Invoice"` are `salesOrderStatus`, NOT the `salesOrderLineStatus` enum
  `Ordered/In Progress/Completed`) before you attribute it, and state the transition fully (an order at
  `"To Ship and Invoice"` flips to `"To Invoice"` once everything has shipped but isn't billed — don't imply
  it sits at one value until fully closed).
- **Em-dashes are rationed — count them.** Hard budget: at most 1 per ~150 words of body prose (a 600-word
  page gets 4, total), never two in one paragraph, never a dash-pair parenthetical in an opening sentence,
  and none in `title=`, `caption=`, or frontmatter strings. Default to a period, comma, or colon; most
  dashes read better as two sentences. Do NOT mimic the dash-heavy style of this skill file or of older
  pages — "too many em-dashes" is the single most common copy note this project gets. Before declaring a
  page done, count (`grep -o '—' <page>.mdx | wc -l`) and cut to budget; when delegating prose to a
  subagent, put the budget in its prompt verbatim.
- **Keep the running example's nouns and numbers exact.** It's the *sales order* (don't drift to a bare
  "order" when instructing the reader) and it's *90 units* (not "a robot"). Once you name the entity and the
  quantity, stay consistent every time — drift is what makes a tour feel sloppy.
- **Ground every "where to click."** When you tell the reader to act in the UI, copy the real button / modal /
  field labels from the JSX (in quotes) and confirm the capability exists *on that exact path*. A feature
  that lives elsewhere is not the same as one on the screen you're describing — "Carbon splits the order into
  three jobs" was wrong: the sales-order line's **"Make to Order"** → **"Convert Line to Job"** dialog makes
  **one** job per click (the N-jobs-of-M split is a separate bulk-jobs flow). Verify the action, not just the
  concept.
- **Callouts carry the counterintuitive truth** — the thing people get wrong. Title is a claim, body is the
  why. ("Quotes are optional — the opportunity is the thread.")
- **Answer the reader's cross-question where it arises.** Every claim raises a next question in the reader's
  head ("what if the job already started?", "does this touch existing orders?", "can I undo it?"). Anticipate
  the one or two most likely at each step and answer them **inline, at that point in the prose** — a short
  sentence, a Callout, or a `<Term>` gloss — never deferred to a separate FAQ section or page. Ground the
  answer in source like any other claim; if you can't answer it from code, that's a research gap, not a
  skip. A section that leaves its obvious "but what about…" hanging isn't done.
- **Explain the why, name the mistake, point to the next step.** If a paragraph does none of those, cut it.
- **Interlink** at natural seams (`[make-to-order tour](/guides/order)`).
- **Lead, don't label.** Don't open a page with a generic, repeated heading — no `## Introduction` on guide
  chapters (the chapter title is rendered for you) and no `## Why it matters` on reference pages. Open with
  1–2 substantive lead sentences, then go straight to the real sections. A heading that's identical on every
  page is filler. Landing/index pages are **"Overview"**, never "Introduction".
- **Name things as they are now.** Use a feature's current name; never narrate rename/removal history
  ("formerly item rules", "storage units used to…"). When an old name and the code disagree, the code wins.

## Interlinking & the glossary

Two linking mechanisms — use **both**, deliberately, every time you touch a page. Internal linking compounds:
a page that links out *and* glosses its jargon is worth more than the same prose in isolation.

- **Markdown links carry navigation.** Link the *noun*, inline, at natural seams; never "click here". A Guide
  links into Reference for fields; Reference links back to the Guide for the story
  (`[make-to-order tour](/guides/order)`). Cross-surface and cross-flow links are expected, not optional.
  **But link only when the destination's title echoes your anchor text.** A hard jump whose landing page has
  a different H1 disorients the reader — linking the phrase "quote to cash" to a chapter titled *From quote
  to order* got flagged as confusing. When the anchor is a *concept* (a flow name, a category) rather than a
  page literally called that, gloss it as a `<Term>` (definition popover + optional "Learn more" via `href`)
  instead of a bare link — the reader gets the meaning in place and can still navigate if they choose.
- **`<Term>` carries definitions.** Wrap a manufacturing/Carbon term a reader can hit cold (method type,
  replenishment system, WIP, outside operation, kit/subassembly…) so a click gives the gloss without leaving
  the page.
  - `<Term>make to order</Term>` slugifies the text to find the entry; `<Term id="make-to-order">made</Term>`
    when the display text differs from the slug.
  - **First occurrence per page only** — not every instance. Underlining every "order" is noise.
  - Definitions are a single source of truth: `@carbon/glossary` (`packages/glossary/src/terms.ts`),
    where each entry is `slug → { term, definition }` with `term`/`definition` as Lingui `msg` descriptors
    (rendered by `docs/components/editorial/glossary.tsx`).
    Add the entry there *before* you use a new term, and **ground the definition in source** (the prime
    directive applies — exact enum values, real behavior). Omit `href` when there's no dedicated page yet (the
    popover still shows the definition); the "Learn more" link auto-hides when it would point at the page
    you're already on.
  - Unknown slug → renders as plain text (never breaks prose) — a typo fails safe, not loud.

**Enrichment pass.** Whenever you create or edit a page, finish with a linking pass: wrap first-occurrence
jargon in `<Term>`, add markdown cross-links at the seams, and add any missing glossary entries. Cheapest way
to raise the whole site's connectivity.

## Design / styling

- **Light-only.** Warm-paper palette: page bg `#FBFBF9` / `#F5F5F2`; ink `#262323` (+ `rgba(38,35,35,0.x)`
  for faint); accent `#1E84B0` (links) / `#00B0FF` (focus/brand); hairlines `#E7E7E3` / `#E3E3DF`.
- **Inline Tailwind arbitrary values** (`text-[15px]`, `bg-[#FBFBF9]`, `border-[#E7E7E3]`) — this app is
  standalone (NOT `@carbon/react`, NOT the ERP theme). Match the surrounding component's density and colors;
  don't introduce a new palette.
- Fonts: DM Sans (body), Fira Code (mono). Callout tone fills/borders: neutral `#EFEFEB/#DADAD5`,
  blue `#DFF5FF/#A9DAF3`, green `#E4F8DA/#A8DB91`, amber `#FFF2D8/#E6CFA3`.

## Gotchas (hard-won)

- **Frontmatter is YAML — never leave an unquoted colon in a value.** A `title:`/`description:` value
  containing `: ` (colon-space) is parsed as a nested mapping and throws
  `YAMLException: bad indentation of a mapping entry`. Either quote the whole value
  (`description: "How it works: the short version."`) or reword to drop the colon (a comma/period is usually
  the better fix). **One bad frontmatter 500s the *entire* site, not just that page** — fumadocs loads the
  whole source collection at module load, so the symptom is every page (guides included) returning 500 with
  the offending `.mdx` path in the stack. This bites hardest during an em-dash sweep: replacing a
  `description:` em-dash with a colon silently breaks YAML. **`pnpm exec fumadocs-mdx` regen does NOT catch
  it** (it passes) — the only reliable check is fetching a page (any page) and seeing 200 vs 500. When you
  delegate prose edits to subagents, tell them explicitly: in frontmatter, never introduce an unquoted colon.
- **Shiki theme** (`source.config.ts` → `rehypeCodeOptions.themes`): set **both** `light` and `dark` to the
  same `"github-dark-default"`. A single `theme` (or a missing `github-light`) breaks the build for any
  `content/docs` file with a code fence (`ShikiError: Theme github-light not found`). Guides have no fences,
  so they're immune — handy for isolating a red build to the Reference side.
- **Regen `.source` before typecheck** after any frontmatter/schema change (the schema is baked into
  `.source/` at generate time).
- **Figure keys must exist** — see the list above; a typo renders nothing, silently.
- **Inline code chips are for identifiers, never statements.** A full command, SQL statement, or long
  path in an inline `` `…` `` span renders as one unbroken chip that can overflow its container —
  anything that reads as a *line of code* goes in a fenced block (fences are fine inside Callouts),
  and inline stays for short tokens (`companyId`, `crbn_…`, `Settings → X` labels stay plain bold).
- **Bare `{…}` in MDX is a JS expression.** A token in prose like `{item.id}` (e.g. inside an example rule
  message) fails the build with `item is not defined`. Wrap any literal braces/tokens in backticks: `` `{item.id}` ``.
- **`Write` blocks on existing files** — natural collision protection when a parallel session co-writes the
  docs. Just write the next uncovered gap; don't pause to coordinate unless asked.
- **`curl` GET can 405 in this sandbox** (a method-less request reads as POST) — use the WebFetch tool for
  external pages; the pnpm registry works fine.
- **Don't hand-edit the API reference** (generated) — change the generator/schema and rebuild.

## Deep-dive references (read when you reach the relevant phase)

- `references/components.md` — full component APIs for both surfaces + the illustration registry.
- `references/writing-guide.md` — the voice, the grounding rule, worked examples.
- `references/information-architecture.md` — the flow IA and the Reference `meta.json` nav.
- `references/design-language.md` — palette, fonts, the inline-Tailwind convention.

> The app diverged from them. **The live components in `docs/components/{editorial,api}/` are the source

## Verification bar

**Mechanical gate — run on every touched page BEFORE the re-read; each must come back clean.** These are
deterministic, so there is no judgment call to get lazy on:

Measure READER-VISIBLE content only — raw `wc -w` counts frontmatter and the invisible `<AgentContext>`
block too, overstating a page by up to 40% and making budgets meaningless:

```bash
awk '/<AgentContext>/{s=1} !s{print} /<\/AgentContext>/{s=0}' <page>.mdx | wc -w              # words vs the type's budget
awk '/<AgentContext>/{s=1} !s{print} /<\/AgentContext>/{s=0}' <page>.mdx | grep -o '—' | wc -l  # em-dashes ≤ 1 per ~150 words
grep -n '<StatusFlow>' <page>.mdx                         # bare = gray pills; must carry entity="…"
grep -nE '^(title|description): [^"]*: ' <page>.mdx       # unquoted colon-space = YAML, 500s the site
grep -m1 '^description:' <page>.mdx | wc -c               # ≤ ~170 raw (the SEO meta: 150–160 chars of text)
```

Plus two eyeball checks no grep covers: a `## Troubleshooting` heading may exist only inside
`<AgentContext>`, and every `<Figure illustration=…>` key is in the registry list.

Never declare docs done without: the mechanical gate passing, the new content rendering (in the user's
running dev server, or a clean `pnpm --filter docs build`), every internal link resolving, any new
`<Term>` glossary entries grounded in source + their popovers rendering, names matching real code,
**no generic repeated headings**, and a re-read that confirms each page says what matters / names the
mistake / points onward.

**Close with a media manifest.** The final report to the user MUST end with the list of images/media the
work needs captured — every unfilled `<Screenshot>` slot on a page you created or touched, one line each:
`page path — slot label (ratio) — what to capture (screen + state)`. Build it with
`grep -n '<Screenshot' <touched pages>`. That list is the user's capture worklist; a slot you don't
report is a slot that never gets filled. No new slots → say "no new media needed" explicitly. Then
record progress (the `.ai/plans/` plan file if one exists, + memory). **Don't kill or rebuild under the user's running dev server.**
