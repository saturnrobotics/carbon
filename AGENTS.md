# Carbon — Agent Guidelines

Carbon is a manufacturing ERP/MES/QMS. It contains apps for ERP, MES, academy, and starter.

## Fork maintenance policy

Read [the fork policy](.fork/agent-policy.md) before every task. For work retained on
this fork, its artifact paths and verification requirements override inherited
`.ai/` writing and generated-file shortcuts in the guides below. Read upstream
lessons as context; write new fork lessons, specs, plans, and records under `.fork/`.
For upstream integration, conflict resolution, generated artifacts, or maintenance
of these safeguards, use [.claude/skills/fork-maintenance/SKILL.md](.claude/skills/fork-maintenance/SKILL.md).

## Public Fork Privacy

- Treat every tracked file and published change as public. Never add private company details to code, comments, documentation, fixtures, screenshots, prompts, plans, run logs, commit messages, issues, or PRs.
- Use synthetic data and generic examples such as `example.com`. Keep real company/customer/supplier data, internal domains, email addresses, project IDs, tailnet details, credentials, backups, and runtime deployment configuration outside tracked files. Use `contrib/deploying/gcp-tailscale/.local/` for local deployment inputs and artifacts; use the deployment's secret store for credentials.
- Before staging or publishing, review the actual diff and artifacts for private details. Never force-add ignored private files. Git ignore rules do not protect already tracked files or redact Git history; stop publication and report any exposure without repeating the sensitive value.
- Preserve upstream copyright, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` files where present, and enterprise/third-party license boundaries. Keep fork changes public and provide the source for the deployed revision. Follow [public-fork maintenance](docs/public-fork.md) when updating upstream or deploying.

## Always

- Check the Task Router below before research or coding; a single task may match multiple rows — read all relevant guides.
- Use the closest package/module `AGENTS.md` for local architecture, imports, and validation commands.
- Follow `.claude/rules/` for subsystem-specific conventions (auto-loaded via `paths:` frontmatter).
- Read `.ai/lessons.md` before non-trivial changes to avoid known pitfalls.
- Preserve behavior unless the user or a spec explicitly asks for a behavior change.
- Keep changes minimal, focused, and integrated through real call sites.
- All added or changed code must pass the applicable lint and formatting rules before handoff or commit. Run scoped safe autofixes, inspect the diff, and fix remaining diagnostics properly; never leave lint cleanup as user homework (see Lint Requirements below).
- Use existing components — grep `packages/react/src/` and `apps/erp/app/components/` before writing UI.
- Enter plan mode for non-trivial tasks (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean.
- Run `pnpm run generate:types` after schema/migration changes, BEFORE typechecking.
- Never claim work is complete without running verification commands. Evidence before assertions — run the command, read the output, then state the result.

## Ask First

- Ask before reducing scope, changing architecture, changing public contracts, or adding production dependencies.
- Ask before changing database schema in production-critical tables.
- Ask before modifying authentication, RBAC, or multi-tenancy logic.
- Ask before touching multiple modules in a way not covered by an existing spec.

## Never

- Never use `npm` — always `pnpm`.
- Never use JavaScript `Date` for parsing, formatting, or arithmetic — use `@internationalized/date` + `@carbon/utils` `formatDate` (see `.claude/rules/date-handling.md`).
- Never expose cross-tenant data or skip `companyId` scoping.
- Never query inside a loop (N+1) — collect the ids and make one `.in()` call, an embed, or a view (see `.claude/rules/database-patterns.md`).
- Never chain Supabase-client writes and call it a transaction — the client has none. Use a Kysely transaction, or an RPC when it must also be callable from an edge function.
- Never construct a DB connection/pool/Kysely client inside a `{module}.service.ts` — service files are re-exported through the module barrel that client components import, so they are bundled for the browser. Build the client in a `.server` file (`getDatabaseClient()` from `~/services/database.server`) and pass it into the service as a `db: Kysely<KyselyDatabase>` argument from the route action. Enforced by the `no-db-client-in-service` check (`@carbon/checks`).
- Never hand-edit generated DB types (`@carbon/database` types).
- Never scatter service/models files — one `{module}.service.ts` and one `{module}.models.ts` per module.
- Never rebuild the database to test changes — wait for the user.
- Never commit credentials, tokens, or private keys.

## Lint Requirements

- Use the existing autofixer on the files/packages being changed: `pnpm exec biome check --write <changed-paths>`. This applies safe fixes, formatting, and import organization. Do not apply blanket `--unsafe` fixes.
- Fix the underlying issue for every remaining error or warning introduced by the change. Do not prefix unused names with `_`, add dummy reads such as `void error`, disable rules, or add suppression comments merely to silence diagnostics. Remove unnecessary bindings or correct incomplete logic while preserving side effects and required API contracts. For an intentionally unused caught exception, use `catch { ... }`.
- Re-run `pnpm exec biome check --error-on-warnings <changed-paths>` after fixes, then the relevant tests and scoped typecheck when behavior or types are affected. Confirm the intended files were actually checked; an ignored/unmatched file is not lint proof. Use the appropriate checks for languages outside Biome's coverage.
- Keep fixes scoped. Report unrelated pre-existing findings accurately without weakening lint configuration or disguising them as a passing check. Fix newly introduced diagnostics before declaring work complete; the commit hook is a backstop, not the first lint run.

## Validation Commands

Choose the smallest relevant set for the change:

```bash
pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=<pkg>   # TypeScript (scoped — whole-repo typecheck OOMs)
pnpm run lint                # Biome linting
pnpm run test                # Unit tests
pnpm run build               # Full build
pnpm db:migrate:new <name>   # Create new migration
pnpm db:migrate              # Apply pending migrations
pnpm run generate:types      # Regenerate DB types (after migrations)
pnpm db:check:datasets       # Do the demo datasets still apply? (pre-commit gate)
pnpm db:check:backups        # Would existing customer backups still restore? (pre-commit gate)
```

Both `db:check:*` commands read your live local schema. They run from
`.husky/pre-commit`, so run `pnpm db:migrate` before either — a stale database makes
the dataset check fail for the wrong reason and makes the backup check refuse to give
a verdict at all. Run by hand, both write nothing; from the hook, `db:check:backups`
additionally regenerates and stages `packages/jobs/manifests/schema.json` on success.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First:** Make every change as simple as possible. Minimize code impact.
- **No Laziness:** Identify root causes. Avoid temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact:** Touch only what is necessary. Avoid introducing new bugs.
- **Demand Elegance:** For non-trivial changes, pause and ask whether there is a more elegant solution.

## Workflow Orchestration

### Plan First

- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions).
- If something goes wrong, stop and re-plan immediately.
- Write implementation plans to `.ai/plans/{date}-{slug}.md` with checkable progress items (run logs go in `.ai/runs/`).

### Subagent Strategy

- Use subagents liberally to keep the main context window clean.
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents.
- One task per subagent to ensure focused execution.

### Verification Before Done

- Never declare a task complete without proving it works.
- Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check build, demonstrate correctness.

### Self-Improvement Loop

- After corrections, update `.ai/lessons.md` with the `Context → Problem → Rule → Applies to` format.
- Review lessons at the start of each session when relevant to the task.

## Architecture Quick Reference

- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- **Framework**: React Router v7 (NOT Remix), flat routes via `remix-flat-routes`
- **Database**: Supabase (Postgres) with RLS, typed via `@carbon/database` + Kysely
- **Background jobs**: Inngest (NOT Trigger.dev), via `@carbon/jobs`
- **Apps**: `erp` (main), `mes` (shop floor), `academy` (training), `starter` (example)
- **Packages**: 23 under `packages/` — auth, database, lib, react, form, documents, jobs, notifications, config, env, checks, harness, dev, stripe, ee, tiptap, locale, glossary, utils, kv, printing, onboarding, logger
- **Multi-tenancy**: every table has `companyId` + composite PK `("id", "companyId")`
- **IDs**: `id('prefix')` default in SQL
- **Imports**: `~/*` → app code; `@carbon/*` → workspace packages
- **Precision**: `packages/utils/src/math.ts` re-exports `functions/shared/precision.ts` by design (the edge runtime only mounts `supabase/functions/`) — not an import to "fix"

## ERP Module Layout

```
apps/erp/app/modules/{module}/
├── {module}.models.ts    # zod validators + derived types
├── {module}.service.ts   # Supabase/Kysely data operations
├── {module}.server.ts    # server-only helpers (optional)
├── types.ts              # shared types (optional)
├── index.ts              # barrel re-export
└── ui/                   # feature components
```

MES is lighter: services in `apps/mes/app/services/`, components in `apps/mes/app/components/`.

## Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

Internal technical context for each subsystem lives in `.claude/rules/` (the source of truth, tracked in git) and is copied to `.codex/rules/` by `install-skills.sh`. Claude Code auto-loads rules via `paths:` frontmatter when you work in matching areas. Update the relevant rule when you learn something durable about a subsystem. The source of truth is always the code and schema first.

## Browser Automation

With the user's permission, use the `/auth` and `/test` skill to verify fixes.
