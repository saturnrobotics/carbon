# --- Ops image (DB migrations + first-boot seed) --------------------------
# The migrate Job (supabase migration up) and the seed Helm hook (tsx src/seed.ts)
# repurpose the app build to run one-off ops tasks. They need the supabase CLI
# and tsx/esbuild — exactly the build tooling the `runner` stage strips for its
# CVE posture. Rather than un-harden the served image, publish a separate
# un-stripped ops image from the `deps` stage for those short-lived Jobs. It is
# never exposed and is scanned report-only (it intentionally carries build-tool
# CVEs). migrate.yml and charts/apps seed-job point at carbon/ops:<same-tag>.
# Kept BEFORE `runner` so `runner` remains the default (no --target) build stage.

# Strip build-time CLI tooling that the multi-stage copy drags into the runtime
# node_modules but the running server (react-router-serve) never executes: the
# prebuilt Go binaries inside sst's CLI, esbuild, the supabase CLI, and the
# typescript-go preview. They trail the current Go security release and are the
# only Trivy CRITICAL/HIGH left once the JS deps are patched, so removing them
# clears the findings at the source and shrinks the image. The `sst` JS package
# (import { Resource }) is kept — only its platform CLI binary is dropped.
# `tar` is stripped for the same reason: its sole consumer is the supabase CLI
# (removed just above), no app runtime imports it, and its GHSA-r292-9mhp-454m
# DoS fix (tar@7.5.21) is not published to npm yet — so it cannot be pinned away
# and is instead removed from the image where the scanner sees it.
# npm itself is stripped for the same reason: the runtime uses corepack/pnpm and
# never invokes npm, but npm (pulled as a devDep via linguito, and shipped
# globally by the node base image) vendors its own copies of tar/pacote/sigstore/
# ip-address/etc. — including the only remaining Trivy CRITICALs (npm's bundled
# tar). Dropping npm clears those at the source and shrinks the image.
