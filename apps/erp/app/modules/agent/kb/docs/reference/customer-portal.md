# Customer portal

> A standing, read-only link where a customer watches their open orders and shop-floor progress, no Carbon account needed.

The customer portal is a **standing, read-only window** into one customer's work. Where a `docs/reference/quotes` closes a deal, the portal is what the buyer watches afterward: their sales order lines with status, the buyer and engineer contacts, order and due dates, part number and revision, quantity complete, quantity shipped, and per-operation job progress. There are no forms — the customer can look, not act.

## Creating a portal

Open **Sales → Portals** and create a portal for the customer. Each row carries the portal's private URL with a copy control; send that link to your customer contact. The link needs no login, so whoever holds the URL can open it — treat it like a password and send it only to the right person.

A portal is scoped to a single customer record: it lists that customer's orders and nothing else. Files attached to their job operations can be downloaded from the portal, limited to the customer's own jobs and rate-limited per visitor.

## Troubleshooting

### Why does the customer portal link show "Not found" / a 404?
The customer portal is gated behind the `CUSTOMER_PORTALS` plan feature (Business plan). A company without it gets a 404 on the portal URL (and a 403 on file downloads). Upgrade the plan to enable the portal.

### Why did downloads from the portal start failing (HTTP 429)?
File downloads on the portal are rate-limited to ten per minute per IP. Wait a minute and retry; the limit is per requesting IP address, not per file.
