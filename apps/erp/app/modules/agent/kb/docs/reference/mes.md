# The MES app

> The shop-floor surface where operators run operations, report quantities, issue material, and log their time.

Carbon is two apps over one data model: the ERP is the office, the MES is the floor. Where a planner releases and schedules work in the ERP, an operator picks up that work here, on a station tablet or a shared kiosk, and reports it back in real time. This page is the scannable map of that surface. For the narrative walkthrough, read the `guides/floor`; for the entities behind it, see `docs/reference/jobs`, `docs/reference/picking`, and `docs/reference/quality`.

Every mutation here hits the network. The MES keeps an IndexedDB read-cache for the item and people pickers so a scan stays snappy, but there is **no offline mode**: without a connection you cannot start, report, or issue anything.

## Getting onto the floor

An operator signs in on the login screen with whichever methods the company has enabled: **"Sign in with Google"**, **"Sign in with Outlook"**, **"Sign in with Passkey"**, or **"Sign in with Email"** (a magic link, which lands on a **"Check your email"** confirmation). The available buttons follow the company's `AUTH_PROVIDERS`, so a floor that only allows passkeys sees only that one.

Once in, the operator sets their context. If the company has more than one location, a **"Location"** submenu appears in the sidebar to pick which floor they're standing on. With a single location the choice is skipped entirely. This selection scopes the board, the assigned lists, and everything they report.

### Console (shared-station) mode

A single tablet bolted to a work center can't ask every operator to log in and out all shift. **Console mode** turns that station into a shared kiosk. It's gated by the `consoleEnabled` company setting, and when on, the sidebar exposes a **"Console Mode"** toggle.

In console mode an operator identifies themselves with a **4-digit PIN**, not a full login. The station prompts to enter a PIN for the named operator, checks it, and attributes the work to that person. Two things stop cold when the PIN is wrong or missing: the station shows **"Incorrect PIN"**, or **"No PIN set. Please set a PIN in your account settings."** if the person never configured one.

A shared station is meant to hand off. **"Switch Operator"** re-prompts for a PIN so the next person takes over, and **"Pin Out"** clears the current operator. Ending the shift also pins out automatically. The PIN identifies *who did the work*; it is not a substitute for the person's real account.

## The operations board

The released work lands on the **"Schedule"** board: a Kanban with one column per work center, each column holding that center's queued operations sorted by **dispatch priority** so the top card is always the next thing to run.

The board is **display and filter only**. A Display popover lets each station tune its own view, toggling **"Empty work centers"** on or off and showing or hiding **"Customer"**, **"Description"**, **"Due Date"**, **"Duration"**, **"Progress"**, **"Status"**, **"Sales Order"**, and **"Thumbnail"** on each card. Filters narrow the queue by **"Work Center"**, **"Process"**, **"Tag"**, or **"Assignee"**.

Operators can filter and focus, but they cannot drag a card to reschedule it. Rebalancing the plan, moving an operation to a different work center or shifting a job's dates, happens on the `docs/reference/scheduling`, where a planner owns the sequence. What reaches the floor is the result.

### Focused lists

Alongside the board, three sidebar lists cut the queue down to what one operator cares about right now:

  - **Assigned to Me**: Operations assigned to the signed-in operator, grouped by work center. Empty state: **"No assigned operations"**.
  - **Active**: Operations the operator currently has running (a production event is open). Empty state: **"No active operations"**.
  - **Recent**: Operations the operator recently touched, for quick return. Empty state: **"No recent operations"**.

Each card carries a status badge, its progress, and a deadline chip (**"ASAP"**, **"No Deadline"**, or a date that turns red when overdue). The badge tracks the operation's own status, not the job's.

### Open Jobs

The **"Open Jobs"** list is the job-level view: columns for **Job**, **Item**, **Quantity**, **Tracking**, **Assignee**, **Due Date**, **Deadline**, and **Status**. One relabel to know here, because it trips people up:

The ERP job status jobs reach when they're cleared to run is `Ready`, but the MES Open Jobs list renders that same value as **"Released"** — the floor's word for "you can start this now." It's a display alias, not a different status. `Closed` jobs also surface in this list.

Opening a job shows its operations as a directed graph (the routing DAG), so an operator sees what feeds what. The toolbar lays it out **"Left to Right"** or **"Top to Bottom"** and offers **"Fit"**; nodes flag a **"Rework"** loop and a scrapped-quantity count when they apply.

## Running an operation

Open an operation and the station panel is where the shift actually happens. A big control starts and stops the clock: **"Start"** opens a production event, **"Pause"** closes it. A toggle picks which kind of time is being logged, matching the three production event types: **"Setup"**, **"Labor"**, or **"Machine"**. The panel is tabbed into **details**, **model** (the 3D part view), **procedure** (work instructions, with **attributes** and **parameters** sub-views), and **chat** (a per-operation note thread).

### The guided assembly view

An operation whose type is **Assembly** opens a guided 3D view instead of a plain part model: the assembly plays back one step at a time, and each step lights up the components it installs.

Deep into a build this creates a problem. The parts already fitted sit between the camera and the ones the current step is naming, so the operator is looking at a finished-looking lump and guessing where the next piece goes. A view control in the player toolbar answers that directly:

  - **Build**: The assembly as it stands on the bench right now: everything fitted so far is solid, and anything from a later step is not drawn. This is the default.
  - **Focus**: The already-fitted parts fade to see-through, so the current step's components are visible in place without losing the shape around them.
  - **Isolate**: Only the current step's components are drawn. The "just show me the part I am fitting" view.
  - **Full**: Every component solid, the finished product.

The view only changes what the operator sees. It never changes the step order, the components a step installs, or anything reported back.

Picking a view that hides parts also stops the camera treating them as obstacles. On **Isolate** the view angle frames the current step's components directly, rather than angling around geometry that is no longer on screen.

The same control appears in the ERP assembly editor, where an author checks that a step reads clearly before publishing. An author and an operator ask the model the same question, so the buttons mean the same thing on both screens.

### Reporting quantities

Good, bad, and reworked units are reported separately, so yield stays honest:

  - **Log Completed**: Records good units off this operation. **"Complete All"** fills the remaining quantity; **"Total Quantity"** sets it explicitly.
  - **Log Scrap**: Records scrapped units against a required **"Scrap Reason"**, so the loss is attributable. The unit flips to **"Scrapped"**, a replacement is spawned, and the routing reopens — see `docs/reference/scrap`.
  - **Log Rework**: Records units reworked in place at this operation, without sending them anywhere.

Reworking *in place* is different from sending a unit back upstream. **"Create Rework"** does the latter: pick an operation under **"Go back to operation"**, give a **"Reason for rework"**, and Carbon re-runs every operation from that point forward to the current one.

Closing the operation is a distinct action. **"Finish"** ends any open events and flips the operation to `Done`. If quantities or steps aren't satisfied Carbon warns (**"Insufficient quantity"**, **"Steps are missing"**) and offers **"Finish Anyways"**. A guard also fires when tracked material was never issued; the operator must acknowledge **"I understand and want to complete without issuing"** to proceed.

**"End Operations"** ends *all* the operator's active production events at once (a clean end-of-shift stop) and, when time cards are on, clocks them out. It does **not** complete or finish any operation. The work stays exactly where it was, ready to resume next shift.

### Issuing material

Material is consumed against an operation from the same panel. The **"Issue"** action has an Adjustment Type: **"Add to Inventory"** (a `Positive Adjmt.`) or **"Pull from Inventory"** (a `Negative Adjmt.`). For serial- or batch-tracked material, tabs let the operator **"Scan"** a barcode, **"Select"** from stock, or **"Unconsume"** to return material already issued.

Two edge cases surface right in the flow rather than failing silently. Issuing expired stock is governed by a policy (`Warn`, `Block`, or `BlockWithOverride`); an overridable block asks for a **"Reason for issuing expired stock"**. And when a pick splits a batch, the station reports a **"Batch Split Occurred"** and offers to **"Convert to New Size/Revision"** or scrap the remainder.

### Clocking in and out

When the `timeCardEnabled` company setting is on, the sidebar carries a time card: **"Clock In"** and **"Clock Out"**, a **"My Hours"** view (a table of **Date**, **Clock In**, **Clock Out**, **Duration**), and a **"Clocked in since"** badge with the start time while a shift is open. Leave a shift open too long and Carbon nudges: after twelve hours it asks **"Forgot to Clock Out?"** with **"I'm Still Working"** or **"Set Clock Out"**. Time cards are labor time for payroll and presence; they are separate from the per-operation production events that drive job costing.

## Picking, quality, inspections, and maintenance

The floor does more than run operations. Four adjacent surfaces live in the same app.

### On-floor picking

The **"Picking"** view lists the picking lists assigned to the operator. **"Start"** moves a list to `In Progress`; **"Finish"** takes it to `Completed`. Each line is worked with **"Pick"**, **"Unpick"**, **"Short"**, or **"Scan"** (for tracked material), and a **"No stock"** badge flags an empty source. A short pick asks **"How many were actually picked?"** and records the shortfall with **"Mark Short"**.

Once a list is `Completed` or `Cancelled` it locks. MES shows **"This picking list is closed. Reopen it from the ERP to continue."** — reopening requires an inventory permission the floor doesn't hold. See `docs/reference/picking` for the full lifecycle.

### Quality issues and inspections

An operator who spots a problem raises it without leaving the station. **"Create Quality Issue"** captures an **"Issue Type"**, a **"Priority"** (Low, Medium, High, or Critical), and a **"Description"**, and files a non-conformance for quality to triage. See `docs/reference/quality` for how that record is worked.

Inspections and work instructions run as typed steps inside the procedure tab. A step is one of nine kinds:

  - **Task**: A do-this instruction the operator marks complete.
  - **Checkbox**: A yes/no confirmation.
  - **Value**: A recorded text or free value.
  - **Measurement**: A numeric reading with bounds — out of range, Carbon warns that the value must fall between the configured min and max for the unit of measure.
  - **Timestamp**: Captures the moment the step was done.
  - **List**: A choice from a predefined list.
  - **Person**: Records who performed the step.
  - **File**: An uploaded attachment (a photo, a document).
  - **Inspection**: A pass/fail gate with a **"Passed Inspection"** switch.

### Maintenance dispatch

When a machine goes down, an operator raises a maintenance dispatch from the floor. Every dispatch created here is `Reactive` by source (scheduled and non-conformance dispatches originate elsewhere). It carries a severity, a priority, and an OEE impact; choosing an OEE impact of **"Down"** ends the work center's active production events, because the center can't produce while it's under repair. The maintenance worker executes it from a detail view with Play, Pause, and Complete controls, a **"Time Worked"** total, and a **"Spare Parts"** section (**"Add & Issue"**), landing on **"Maintenance Completed"** when done.

## Troubleshooting

The exact blocks operators hit on the floor, and what unblocks each.

### "Incorrect PIN"
In console mode the 4-digit PIN entered for the named operator didn't match. Re-enter it, or use **"Switch Operator"** to pick the right person. The PIN identifies who did the work; it is not the person's login password.

### "No PIN set. Please set a PIN in your account settings."
The named operator has never configured a console PIN, so console mode can't attribute work to them. They set one in their account settings (in the ERP), then the station can pin them in.

### "This picking list is closed. Reopen it from the ERP to continue."
The picking list is already `Completed` or `Cancelled`, which locks it — the floor can't pick, unpick, short, or scan against a closed list. Reopening it requires an inventory permission the MES doesn't hold; a user reopens it from the ERP.

### Finish is blocked or warns ("Insufficient quantity" / "Steps are missing")
**"Finish"** flips the operation to `Done`, but guards fire first. If reported quantity is short you'll see **"Insufficient quantity"**; if procedure steps aren't satisfied, **"Steps are missing"**. You can override with **"Finish Anyways"**. Separately, if tracked material was never issued, the operator must tick **"I understand and want to complete without issuing"** to proceed.

### "Forgot to Clock Out?"
A time card was left open for twelve hours or more. Choose **"I'm Still Working"** to keep the shift open, or **"Set Clock Out"** to close it. Time cards are labor/presence time for payroll — separate from the per-operation production events that drive job costing.

### The Console Mode toggle or the time card isn't there
Both are company-setting gated. **"Console Mode"** only appears when `consoleEnabled` is on; the **"Clock In"/"Clock Out"** time card (and the 12-hour prompt) only appear when `timeCardEnabled` is on. If a floor needs either, an admin enables it in company settings.

### I can't drag a card to reschedule on the floor
The MES **"Schedule"** board is display and filter only — it never reschedules. Rebalancing the plan (moving an operation to another work center, or shifting a job's dates) happens on the `docs/reference/scheduling`, where a planner owns the sequence.
