# Purchasing Module

Purchase orders, supplier management, supplier quotes/interactions, RFQs, and procurement planning. Handles the full procure-to-receive lifecycle including supplier approval workflows, quote finalization, and conversion to purchase orders.

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Purchase Order (PO)** — document sent to a supplier. Statuses: Draft → Needs Approval → To Review → To Receive → To Receive and Invoice → To Invoice → Completed. MUST use `closePurchaseOrder` to close manually.
- **PO Revision** — `purchaseOrder.revisionId` counts amendments to a released order. Created ONLY when the header dropdown's "Create PO Revision" action posts `createRevision=true`; a plain Reopen never bumps. The write is `reopenPurchaseOrderAsRevision` (Kysely, `purchasing.service.ts`): a compare-and-swap that sets `revisionId = revisionId + 1` **in SQL** with the eligibility conditions (locked status + non-null `orderDate`) in the WHERE clause, so concurrent requests can't collide and an ineligible order matches 0 rows. `canCreatePurchaseOrderRevision` (`purchasing.models.ts`) is the matching pure predicate used to gate the menu item — keep the two in sync. Unlike quotes, a PO revision is in-place: no new row, receipts/invoices stay attached. Displayed as `PO000123-1` when > 0 via `getPurchaseOrderDisplayId` (`@carbon/documents/utils`) on the PDF, email, filenames, and UI; the two-tone in-app rendering uses `<RevisionSuffix>` (`~/components`).
- **Supplier Interaction** — umbrella entity linking a supplier quote to RFQs, POs, and documents. A supplier quote always lives under an interaction.
- **Supplier Quote** — vendor-side pricing with line-level price breaks (`supplierQuoteLinePrice`). Can be finalized (`finalizeSupplierQuote`) and converted to POs via the `convert` edge function.
- **RFQ (Request for Quotation)** — solicits pricing from multiple suppliers. Links to supplier quotes via `purchasingRfqToSupplierQuote`. Statuses managed by `updatePurchasingRFQStatus`.
- **Conversion Factor** — when a supplier's UoM differs from stocking UoM, `conversionFactor` on `purchaseOrderLine` scales quantities at receipt: `inventoryQty = purchaseQty × conversionFactor`. See `.claude/rules/purchasing-conversion-factors.md`.
- **Purchasing Planning** — MRP-driven planned orders surfaced via `getPurchasingPlanning` (calls `get_purchasing_planning` RPC).

## Safety

### Always
- MUST scope all queries by `companyId` — purchasing data is multi-tenant.
- MUST use the `convert` edge function for supplier-quote → PO conversion — never hand-roll inserts.
- MUST preserve `conversionFactor` on PO lines when editing — it drives receipt quantity math.
- MUST use `finalizePurchaseOrder` / `finalizeSupplierQuote` for finalization — they enforce business rules.

### Ask First
- Changing PO status (approval/finalization workflows have business rules).
- Deleting suppliers or POs that may have linked receipts or invoices.

### Never
- Bypass the approval workflow by directly setting status to `To Receive`.
- Delete receipt lines that have already been posted to inventory.
- Directly INSERT into `purchaseOrder` — MUST use `insertPurchaseOrder` / `upsertPurchaseOrder`.

## Validation Commands

```bash
# The app's package name is "erp" — there is no "@carbon/erp" workspace.
pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=erp
# apps/erp has no `test` script; run vitest from the app directory.
cd apps/erp && pnpm exec vitest run app/modules/purchasing
```

## Key Data Model

| Table / View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `purchaseOrder` / `purchaseOrders` (view) | PO header: supplier, status, dates, location; view adds `receivableQuantity`/`receivedQuantity` aggregates (drives the list's Received progress bar and the derived "Partially Received" header chip — display-only, not a status enum value) |
| `purchaseOrderLine` | Line items: item, quantity, price, conversionFactor, jobId |
| `purchaseOrderDelivery` / `purchaseOrderPayment` | PO delivery and payment terms |
| `supplier` / `suppliers` (view) | Vendor master: name, type, status, tax info |
| `supplierContact` / `supplierLocation` | Supplier address book |
| `supplierProcess` | Which manufacturing processes a supplier offers |
| `supplierInteraction` | Container for a supplier quote exchange |
| `supplierQuote` / `supplierQuoteLine` / `supplierQuoteLinePrice` | Vendor pricing at quantity breaks |
| `purchasingRfq` / `purchasingRfqLine` / `purchasingRfqSupplier` | RFQ header, lines, and invited suppliers |
| `terms` | Payment/delivery terms reference data |
| `purchaseReturnOrder` / `purchaseReturnOrderLine` / `purchaseReturnOrders` (view) | Supplier returns: authorize → ship (via shipments, source "Purchase Return Order") → credit. Statuses Draft → Confirmed → Partially Shipped → Shipped → Completed/Cancelled; `supplierReference` carries the supplier's own RMA number; line quantities/prices are ALWAYS inventory-UOM (converted once at authoring) |
| `purchaseReturnOrderLineTrackedEntity` / `purchaseReturnOrderCreditLine` | Entities to send back (picked from Available stock from that supplier) — the `create` edge fn (`shipmentFromPurchaseReturnOrder`) stamps these onto the shipment's tracked entities (`attributes ->> Shipment`/`Shipment Line`) so the batch/serial flows through; `post-shipment` **splits** a batch when the returned quantity is less than the entity's (mirrors the Sales Order path, `buildBatchSplitRecords`). Per-line credit breakdown behind the AP `memo` (`memo.purchaseReturnOrderId`, reason account = GRNI). The memo is a **Debit** memo (`DR-` sequence): direction alone picks the control side, so Credit would INCREASE AP and re-debit GRNI — a vendor return must DR AP / CR GRNI |

## Key Service Functions

- `getPurchaseOrder` / `getPurchaseOrders` / `getPurchaseOrderLines` — read POs
- `closePurchaseOrder` — marks a PO closed
- `shortClosePurchaseOrderLine` — Kysely transaction; sets a line's `receivedComplete` ("Stop/Resume Receiving") and recomputes the header status. Open-PO supply queries (`get_inventory_quantities`, `openPurchaseOrderLines`, `get_job_quantity_on_hand`) exclude `receivedComplete` lines, so short-closed remainders stop counting as incoming stock
- `convertSupplierQuoteToOrder` — calls `convert` edge function
- `duplicatePurchaseOrder` — copies a PO with new sequence
- `finalizePurchaseOrder` / `finalizeSupplierQuote` — lock documents for processing
- `sendSupplierQuote` — sends quote to supplier
- `getPurchasingPlanning` — MRP-driven planned order view (RPC `get_purchasing_planning`)
- `getSupplierApprovalContext` — reads approval workflow state
- `getPurchasingRFQ` / `getPurchasingRFQs` / `upsertPurchasingRFQ` — RFQ management
- `getSupplierQuotesForComparison` — side-by-side quote comparison
- `getDefaultAttachmentsForPO` — default document attachments for PO creation
- `getPurchaseReturnOrders` / `insertPurchaseReturnOrder` / `upsertPurchaseReturnOrderLine` — supplier-return CRUD; `confirmPurchaseReturnOrder` (Kysely row-locked caps: receiptLine received → PO line received×factor → invoice line×factor), `cancelPurchaseReturnOrder` / `completePurchaseReturnOrder` / `shortClosePurchaseReturnOrderLine`
- `getReturnableLinesForSupplier` (posted receipt lines minus already-authorized) — thin wrapper over the `get_returnable_receipt_lines` RPC, which does the `received − authorized > 0` filter, the search (receipt #, PO #, item readable id, item name), recency ordering, and limit/offset paging in SQL and returns `totalCount` on each row. Scales to thousands of receipt lines; the "Add lines from receipt" modal (`ReturnableReceiptLinesModal`) shows the 5 most recent and searches for the rest. / `getReturnableEntitiesForSupplier` (Available entities whose `attributes ->> Receipt` resolves to a posted receipt from the supplier) / `getReturnableEntitiesForReceiptLine` (Available entities from ONE receipt line, via `attributes ->> Receipt Line`) — the `$id.new` action uses it to auto-select the single entity when a tracked line is added from a specific receipt, persisting it at creation so it flows onto the shipment
- `createPurchaseReturnOrderCredit` (Kysely, shipped-minus-credited cap) / `getCreditableQuantitiesForPurchaseReturn` / `createReplacementPurchaseOrder` (linked-PO-line / supplierPart pricing)
