 * An integration's OAuth callback is reached by the provider redirecting the
 * user's browser, so it can't render its own failure. It redirects to the
 * integrations page with `?integration=<id>&error=<code>` instead, and the copy
 * is resolved on that page, where Lingui's runtime lives.
 *
 * Only a code crosses the URL, never the provider's message: a value like OAuth's
 * `error_description` is chosen by whoever crafted the redirect to a public
 * callback, so reflecting it would put attacker-authored text in a Carbon toast.
 * The raw value is logged in the callback instead.
