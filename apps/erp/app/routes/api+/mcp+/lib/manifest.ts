/**
 * The MCP server's own manifest, served at `/.well-known/mcp.json`.
 *
 * Shaped as the Model Context Protocol registry's `server.json`: `remotes[]`
 * with `type: "streamable-http"` is the field a client or a registry reads to
 * learn how to connect. Everything Carbon-specific lives under `_meta`, so the
 * document stays valid against that schema rather than growing ad-hoc top-level
 * keys a strict validator would reject.
 *
 * The tool counts and module list are derived from `tool-metadata.json` — the
 * same file the server registers from — so the manifest cannot drift from what
 * `search_tools` actually returns. Hard-coding them here is how a manifest ends
 * up promising a module that was removed two releases ago.
