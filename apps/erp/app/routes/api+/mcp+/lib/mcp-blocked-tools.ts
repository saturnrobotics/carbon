  // companyId the dispatcher fills from the caller's own key, so an empty body
  // deletes the caller's tenant. Its "internal users only" gate lives in the
  // settings ROUTE, which no API/MCP call passes through.
  "settings_deleteSubsidiary",

  // a privileged client off the public API rather than teaching the dispatcher to
  // hand one out.

  // They are implementation helpers, not independently callable ERP operations.

  // it re-applies that gate — so the raw trigger must not be reachable via MCP.

  // Unreachable by construction: these tables carry USER-scoped RLS
  // (`"createdBy"::uuid = auth.uid()`, migration 20260228000000_rls-refactor-3.sql),
  // but an API key authenticates by header rather than a Supabase JWT, so
  // `auth.uid()` is NULL and the predicate can never match. Blocked rather than
  // left to fail because the failure is silent for half of them — an UPDATE or
  // DELETE matching zero rows is not an error, so `deleteNote` answered 200 with
  // the row untouched. Making them work is an RLS decision, not an app-code one.
