// Tenant-isolation regression guards for Job Operation Batching (#1010).
// Originally from PR #1137; rewritten for the v2 consolidated migration, which
// scopes candidates via SECURITY INVOKER + RLS (not a company_id parameter) and
// pins batch membership to a company via COMPOSITE tenant FKs. The property
// protected is the same: a batch and its members can never cross a tenant
// boundary. Reads the migration + service text directly — no DB, no app imports
// (the ERP barrels drag lingui `msg` macros vitest does not transform).
