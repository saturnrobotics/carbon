     * CJS interop ("Named export 'func' not found"). In dev the CJS entry is
     * externalized and `require`d directly, which works via pnpm's store.
     * (Gated on `command` — not `isSsrBuild` — because under the environment
     * API the config callback runs once for the whole build, so `isSsrBuild`
     * is unreliable, whereas `command` is always "build" vs "serve".)
