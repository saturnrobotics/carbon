// and set by the deployment. A hostname check can't stand in for that, since

// U.S.-Persons-only environment leaves it, even if the key is set.
//
// The key must be a real PostHog project key (`phc_…`), not just non-empty: a
// placeholder value (e.g. a masked "****" in a local .env) passes a truthiness
// check, and initializing with it makes posthog-js inject its remote-config
// <script> into the document before hydrateRoot(document) runs — an extra DOM
// node React can't match, so the ENTIRE document fails hydration.
