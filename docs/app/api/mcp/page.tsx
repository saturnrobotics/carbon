    q: "What can the assistant actually do?",
    a: "Read and write across every module the identity can reach — query orders and inventory, create jobs, draft quotes, update statuses. It acts as that user, so it can only touch what you've granted."
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need an API key?",
    a: "Not for connector clients — Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, and ChatGPT add the URL and authorize in your browser. Keys are for command and config clients (Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code, Codex) and any headless or CI use."
  },
  {
    q: "Does it respect my Carbon permissions?",
    a: "Yes — there's no way around them. A connector inherits the role and company of whoever authorized it; a key carries its own scopes. The assistant can never do what that identity can't."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I give it read-only access?",
    a: "Yes. Scope a key to only the modules and actions it needs — View with no Create, Update, or Delete makes it read-only. Use a separate key per client so you can re-scope or revoke one without touching the rest."
  },
  {
    q: "Where does my data go?",
    a: "Carbon doesn't send it anywhere new — your MCP client does, to whatever model provider it runs on, under that provider's terms. Scope keys tightly and prefer a read-only key when you only need to read."
  },
  {
    q: "Is the Carbon API available on my plan?",
    a: "On Carbon Cloud, API and MCP access is a Business-plan feature — Starter keys are rejected with 403. Self-hosted, it's one of the Business features, which Enterprise Edition (EE) unlocks with a commercial license. See Licensing for the full picture."
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a rate limit?",
    a: "Each key has its own limit and window — 60 requests per minute by default. It's platform-controlled: the Rate Limit column in Settings → API Keys shows the limit in force, but there's no field to change it. Go over it and calls return 429 with X-RateLimit-* and Retry-After headers telling the client when to retry."
  },
  {
    q: "I'm getting 401 Unauthorized",
    a: "Key clients: the key is missing, malformed, expired, or deleted — recreate it in Settings → API Keys and update the Authorization header. Connector clients: re-authorize the connection from your client."
  },
  {
    q: "I'm getting 403 Forbidden",
    a: "The identity is authenticated but lacks the module permission for that action — or, on Cloud, the company is on the Starter plan. Grant the scope, or switch to a key that has it."
  },
  {
    q: "How do I manage or revoke a key?",
    a: "Each key in Settings → API Keys shows its scopes, rate limit, expiry, and who created it. Delete a key to revoke it instantly; nothing else breaks if you key each client separately."

      <Lead>
        Carbon runs an MCP server, so AI clients — Claude Code, Claude Desktop,
        Cursor, ChatGPT — can reach the Carbon API and read or write your
        manufacturing data in plain language.
      </Lead>
      <P>
        The server lives at <McpEndpoint />. Connect it one of two ways,
        depending on your client.
      </P>

      <H2 id="connect">Connect</H2>
      <P>
        <strong>Connector clients</strong> — Claude.ai, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT
        — add the URL and authorize in your browser. No key needed.
      </P>
      <P>
        <strong>Command &amp; key clients</strong> — Claude Code, Cursor, VS
        Code, Codex — paste a snippet carrying a scoped API key.
      </P>

        The server does not register all{" "}
        {toolCounts().total.toLocaleString()} operations as tools — that
        would flood a model's context. It exposes three meta-tools instead, and
        the model loads only what a task needs:

        <Row head cols="150px 1fr" cells={["Meta-tool", "What it does"]} />
        <Row

          cells={[
            <Code key="s">search_tools</Code>,

          ]}
        />
        <Row
          cols="150px 1fr"
          cells={[
            <Code key="d">describe_tool</Code>,

        <Row

      <P>
        A typical flow is <Code>search_tools</Code> → <Code>describe_tool</Code>{" "}
        → <Code>call_tool</Code>, which keeps the model's context lean no matter
        how large the catalog grows. The same operations are also plain HTTP
        endpoints — every one has a page of its own, listed by module in the
        sidebar.
