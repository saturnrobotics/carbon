/**
 * Every event id a live workflow subscribes to must still resolve. Needs a live database:
 * `pnpm --filter @carbon/checks workflow-events`. Does NOT run in CI — no job in
 * .github/workflows has database credentials. Run it by hand after a catalog change.
 *
 * Two shapes of drift:
 *  - a shipped id the catalog no longer has (a rename left it behind);
 *  - a custom-field id whose `customField` row is gone. That one the catalog cannot
 *    catch on its own — it PARSES those ids rather than looking them up, deliberately,
 *    so that it stays company-blind. The existence check therefore lives here.
