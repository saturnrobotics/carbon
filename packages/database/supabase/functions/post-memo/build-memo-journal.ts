// Pure construction of the GL journal for posting a credit/debit memo. No DB, no
// I/O, no clock — so it is unit-testable with `deno test`. The driver
// (`post-memo-transaction.ts`) resolves the control + reason account ids, the
// reason account's class, the accounting period and `journalLineReference` (all
// impure), then hands them here to compute the balanced double-entry.
//
// A memo is payment-shaped, NOT invoice-shaped: it moves an amount between the
// party's AR/AP control account and a single chosen reason account. There are
// four combos (customer/supplier × credit/debit); two axes drive the posting:
//   * isAR      — customer (AR, asset control) vs supplier (AP, liability control)
//   * direction — 'Credit' or 'Debit'. This alone decides the control side:
//                 a Debit memo DEBITS the control account, a Credit memo CREDITS
//                 it — for BOTH AR and AP. Worked through:
//                   Customer Credit  → reduce AR  → CR asset   (control credit)
//                   Customer Debit   → increase AR→ DR asset   (control debit)
//                   Supplier Credit  → increase AP→ CR liab.   (control credit)
//                   Supplier Debit   → reduce AP  → DR liab.   (control debit)
//                 i.e. controlIsDebit === (direction === 'Debit') universally.
// The reason leg is always the inverse side, booked at the reason account's
// natural class so its stored natural-balance `amount` sign is correct.
//
// A memo is a single-currency document booked at its own exchange rate, so there
// is no realized FX at post time (FX only realizes when CASH later settles the
// memo — a separate payment posting).
//
// Both legs normally use the same base amount, so the entry balances on two
// lines. SUPPLIER RETURNS are the one exception: the return shipment already
// debited GRNI at the goods' CARRIED COST, so the memo must credit GRNI by that
// same carried cost to clear it, while AP moves by what the supplier actually
// agreed to credit. Those two figures are independent, and the difference is a
// purchase price variance — emitted as a third leg. Without it the credit and
// the cost never reconcile and GRNI keeps a permanent residual.
