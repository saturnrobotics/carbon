// Pure construction of the GL journal for posting an AR/AP payment. No DB, no
// I/O, no clock — so it is unit-testable with `deno test`. The driver
// (`index.ts`) resolves the account ids, dimensions, accounting period and
// `journalLineReference` (all impure), then hands them here to compute the
// balanced double-entry. Keeping this pure is what lets the golden-master tests
// pin the exact journal for every AR/AP × partial/full × discount/write-off ×
// FX-gain/loss × unapplied-credit permutation — the lines that hit the general
// ledger must be provably correct, not merely inspected.
//
// TWO independent axes (decoupled so REFUNDS work — a refund is cash flowing the
// "wrong" way for its ledger):
//   * isAR   — does this payment settle AR (customer) or AP (supplier)? Drives
//              account SELECTION (receivables vs payables, customer vs supplier
//              discount/write-off) and the realized-FX gain/loss DIRECTION.
//   * cashIn — does cash come INTO our bank (Receipt) or leave it (Disbursement)?
//              Drives the debit/credit SIDE of every line.
// Normal receipt: isAR && cashIn. Normal disbursement: !isAR && !cashIn.
// AR refund (cash out to a customer against a credit memo): isAR && !cashIn.
// AP refund (cash in from a supplier against a debit memo): !isAR && cashIn.
//
// Posting model (all amounts converted to base currency):
//   1) Cash      — DR Bank (cashIn) / CR Bank (!cashIn). When a processor fee is
//                  deducted AT SOURCE (e.g. Stripe never deposits the gross —
//                  the fee is withheld before the payout lands), the bank line
//                  carries only the NET amount and a same-side fee expense line
//                  makes up the difference, so the entry reflects what actually
//                  moved through the bank rather than a gross deposit that never
//                  happened.
//   2) Per app   — control account (AR/AP) at the TARGET rate so it reverses the
//                  original booking exactly; discount and write-off (also
//                  invoice-currency reliefs) at the target rate; realized FX on
//                  the cash-settled principal accumulated for a single plug.
//   3) Unapplied — cash beyond what was applied becomes new on-account credit;
//                  applying more than the cash draws down existing credit (the
//                  inverse posting side).
//   4) FX plug   — one Realized FX Gain / Loss line for the accumulated FX.
//
// FX sign convention: `totalFxImpact` is normalized by the (isAR ? 1 : -1)
// factor so a POSITIVE value ALWAYS means a gain and a NEGATIVE value ALWAYS
// means a loss, for both AR and AP. This is the same quantity the stored
// `invoiceSettlement.fxGainLossAmount` captures, so the subledger reconciles.
