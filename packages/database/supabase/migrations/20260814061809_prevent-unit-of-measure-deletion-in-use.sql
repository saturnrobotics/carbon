-- Prohibit deleting a unit of measure that is still referenced anywhere.
--
-- The 23 foreign keys to "unitOfMeasure"("code","companyId") disagree about
-- ON DELETE: six CASCADE (purchaseOrderLine x2, purchaseInvoiceLine x2,
-- salesOrderLine, kanban), four SET NULL, thirteen RESTRICT. So deleting a code
-- that had only ever reached the CASCADE tables silently deleted those order,
-- invoice and kanban rows with it. Ten further UoM columns carry no FK at all
-- (salesInvoiceLine, receiptLine, shipmentLine, supplierPart, the three
-- *OperationStep tables, both maintenance item tables, workCenterReplacementPart),
-- so they never blocked anything and were left pointing at a code that no longer
-- existed.
--
-- One BEFORE DELETE guard covers every case, FK or not. The FK actions are
-- deliberately left as they are: the CASCADEs exist so that deleting a company
-- still works (20250430131239_delete-company-2.sql), and this guard returns early
-- on that path exactly as protect_system_required_actions does
-- (20260321002430_delete-company-fix.sql).
--
-- Known limit: for the columns without a foreign key the check is not
-- concurrency-safe. Writing one of them takes no lock on the "unitOfMeasure" row,
-- so a write that commits between this check and the delete's commit can still
-- leave a dangling code. Closing that needs a foreign key or a validating trigger
-- on each of those tables, which is out of scope here.
--
-- Company restore/import are unaffected. They wipe in reverse topological order
-- under session_replication_role='replica' where the role allows it, which
-- disables user triggers outright; and because "unitOfMeasure" references only
-- "company" it sorts first and is therefore wiped last — after every table that
-- points at it — so the guard is a no-op in non-replica mode too.
