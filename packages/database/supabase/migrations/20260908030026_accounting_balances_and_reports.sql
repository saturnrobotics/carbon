-- Invoice balances and reporting normalized to the document/source currency contract.
-- Requires new sourceAmount column. No historical fallback/backfill.
-- Currency precision is group configuration, never a hardcoded two decimals.
-- Save/post refuse missing config/rates; the LEFT JOIN keeps operational draft rows visible.
-- Read balances preserve sub-internal-unit foreign remainders; only ledger lines use internal rounding.

-- Internal-scale rounding boundary for SQL. `no-raw-rounding` in @carbon/checks
-- reads TypeScript only, so a bare `round(x, 5)` here is unguarded: this is the
-- SQL twin of `round(value)` at the default SCALE in
-- packages/database/supabase/functions/shared/precision.ts. Settlement values
-- keep rounding at currency."decimalPlaces" and must NOT use this function.
