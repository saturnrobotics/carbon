-- Kanban Transfer support.
--
-- A "Transfer" kanban creates a stock transfer from one storage unit to another
-- within a location. The existing "storageUnitId" is reused as the DESTINATION
-- (to) bin — consistent with Buy/Make, where it is the bin stock lands in — and
-- a new "fromStorageUnitId" holds the SOURCE bin.
--
-- The kanban replenishment system is retyped from "itemReplenishmentSystem"
-- (Buy | Make | Buy and Make) to a kanban-specific enum. "Transfer" is NOT added
-- to "itemReplenishmentSystem" on purpose: that enum drives item planning, MRP,
-- and demand, where Transfer is not a valid item-level replenishment method.

CREATE TYPE "kanbanReplenishmentSystem" AS ENUM ('Buy', 'Make', 'Transfer');

-- The "kanbans" view is SELECT k.*, so it must be dropped before the column
-- retype and recreated afterwards (also picks up the new column + join).
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS "kanbans";

ALTER TABLE "kanban" ALTER COLUMN "replenishmentSystem" DROP DEFAULT;

-- The old enum (itemReplenishmentSystem) allowed 'Buy and Make', which the new
-- kanban-specific enum does not. Map any such rows to 'Buy' before the cast so
-- the type change cannot abort. (The kanban form never offered 'Buy and Make',
-- so in practice this is a no-op guard against direct DB/API/import writes.)
