-- Job completion receives exactly the completed quantity of a serial-tracked item.
--
-- Bug: for a serial-tracked made item, complete_job_to_inventory received one unit
-- per unconsumed job serial REGARDLESS of p_quantity_complete, and flipped every one
-- of them Available. Completing at 0 therefore put the unit in stock while
-- backflush_job_materials (prorated by the same quantity) consumed nothing, and
-- completing twice received the same serial twice.
--
-- Fix, serial branch only:
--   * receive exactly the newly completed units (p_quantity_complete minus what the
--     job already received), never a unit this job has already received;
--   * take units already finished on the shop floor (Available) first, then by
--     serial number; never a Consumed, Rejected or Scrapped unit;
--   * flip only the received units to Available;
--   * fall back to the whole-quantity seed entity when the item has no serial
--     sequence and its units were never split into numbered serials;
--   * refuse the completion when fewer units are left than are being completed.
-- The job row is locked first so two concurrent completions cannot compute the
-- same receipt delta.
-- Refuse a fractional completion quantity for serial-tracked items.
-- And refuse a completion quantity <= 0 for stocked items: receiving nothing while
-- marking the job Completed is how the unit/material mismatch arose. Non-Inventory
-- (service) completions keep their existing behavior. The fully-scrapped branch of
-- sync_finish_job_operation never calls this function and is unaffected.
--
-- Every stocked item, not only serial:
--   * refuse a cumulative quantity below what the job already received; the
--     negative delta otherwise posted a negative receipt, cost layer and WIP journal;
--   * a re-completion at the received quantity (zero delta) receives nothing and
--     leaves WIP posted since the last receipt in WIP for the next one, instead of
--     dividing that WIP by a zero quantity.
--
-- Recreated VERBATIM from its newest committed definition
-- (20260805023439_company-timezone-sql-functions.sql) apart from the guards, the
-- zero-delta skips and the serial branch.
--
-- sync_finish_job_operation is recreated from 20260727031247 so that marking the
-- last operation Done on a reopened job never asks for less than the job already
-- received.
