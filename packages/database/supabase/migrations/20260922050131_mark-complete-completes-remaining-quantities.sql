-- "Mark as Complete" completes the remaining quantities, not just the status.
--
-- Bug: completing a job from the ERP dialog (or the MCP tool) set
-- job.status = 'Completed' and received the goods, but left every operation's
-- quantityComplete where it was. An operation is only Done once its reported
-- quantity reaches its target, so the routing stayed open and the job kept
-- reading In Progress behind a Completed status. Inventory and the backflush
-- were always correct; it is the operation-level record that was missing.
--
-- Fix: before the status flip, close each open terminal operation — set its
-- quantityComplete to the quantity being completed, and its status to Done.
-- Both are required: the auto-Done predicate lives in
-- sync_update_job_operation_quantities, which fires on productionQuantity
-- writes rather than on a jobOperation update, so a quantity-only write would
-- leave the routing open behind a Completed job.
--
-- No synthetic productionQuantity row is inserted. A desk completion is not
-- shop-floor production and must not fabricate operator-attributed history.
--
-- Closing an operation fires sync_finish_job_operation, which completes the job
-- through the same path MES uses. That re-entry is NOT free: it is a BEFORE row
-- trigger, so it reads the operation's OLD quantityComplete (0 on a desk
-- completion), falls back to the job's planned quantity and receives a SECOND
-- time, while this call's receipt delta was already computed. The close-out
-- therefore runs AFTER the status flip, where the interceptor's Ready/In
-- Progress/Paused gate returns early and no second receipt is posted.
--
-- Serial-tracked jobs are the exception. A serial unit is an individually
-- numbered trackedEntity and cannot be conjured here without bypassing
-- assign-serial-numbers, so a serial job with units still outstanding is
-- refused and the whole completion rolls back — never Completed on a serial
-- requirement that was not satisfied. A serial job already finished in MES has
-- no shortfall and completes normally.
--
-- complete_job_to_inventory is recreated VERBATIM from its newest committed
-- definition (20260916131445_merge-aware-job-receipt.sql); the ONLY change is
-- the PERFORM below, placed immediately AFTER the status UPDATE so the
-- interceptor's roll-up skips the now-Completed job instead of receiving it
-- twice.

-- The 3-argument form below replaces an unreleased 4-argument version that took
-- p_company_id. CREATE OR REPLACE cannot replace a different signature, so drop
-- it explicitly rather than leave a second, callable overload behind.
