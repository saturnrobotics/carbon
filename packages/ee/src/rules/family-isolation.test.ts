// Cross-family isolation for the merged "enforcementRule" table.
//
// Storage and sales rules used to live in separate tables with separate pin
// tables, so leakage between the families was structurally impossible. After
// the merge they share `enforcementRule` AND `enforcementRuleItemAssignment`,
// so isolation is now a property of the queries: every read filters on
// `family`, and pin rows are resolved against a family-filtered rule set rather
// than an embed (an embed would happily return the other family's rule).
//
// These tests drive the real service functions against a fake PostgREST client
// that records the filters applied, so a future edit that drops an `.eq("family",
// …)` — or reintroduces an embed on the shared pin table — fails here.
