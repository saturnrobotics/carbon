// Ship-to resolution for the sales-invoice document gate.
//
// An invoice raised with no upstream document is the bypass this surface
// exists to close: a standalone line has no ship-to and none may be invented,
// so a destination rule must fail CLOSED (required-field violation) rather
// than pass — and must never fall back to the bill-to, which is a different
// address and frequently a different country. An order-derived line resolves
// the real destination through its source order, drop-ship included.
//
// These tests drive the real document evaluator against a fake PostgREST
// client, so a future "fix" that substitutes the bill-to — or reads the order
// header instead of the drop shipment — fails here.
