/**
 * Persist a model's retained raw to DURABLE storage. Uploads and compaction stage
 * in the EPHEMERAL `temp-staging` bucket; the retained raw (the source for the WASM
 * fallback, re-optimise, lazy assembly-plan, and download) must not live there
 * or it is lost when staging is cleared. This function:
 *
 *  - When the assembler is available and the source is a compactable mesh: compacts
 *    it (STEP → OCCT BinXCAF `{id}.xbf.zst`; mesh → `{id}.{ext}.zst`), then
 *    COPIES the compacted `.zst` to `private` if it fits the 50 MB served cap.
 *  - The customer's ORIGINAL bytes always survive. xbf compaction is a format
 *    conversion (no CAD tool opens `.xbf`), so the original STEP is kept alongside
 *    it — copied to `private` when ≤ 50 MB, else staging-only, tracked by
 *    `modelUpload.originalPath` (the staged-raw sweep spares both columns). zstd
 *    compaction is pure compression (the `.zst` decompresses byte-identical), so
 *    the `.zst` replaces the original and `originalPath` is cleared.
 *  - Otherwise (assembler off, non-mesh, or already `.zst`): copies the raw
 *    as-is to `private` if it fits; oversized raws stay in staging (never pruned —
 *    they may be the only copy of the customer's file).
 *
 * This function DELETES NOTHING from staging: an instant move/remove races any
 * concurrent optimize/convert/plan that resolved `temp-staging` as its source
 * bucket moments earlier ("Object not found" → Failed run, zombie viewer). The
 * scheduled cleanup sweep owns staging deletion: stale objects with a durable
 * copy, or referenced by no modelUpload, are pruned after the TTL.
 *
 * Fired after model-optimize settles (success, failure, or assembler-off skip), so
 * a failed/skipped optimise still gets its raw persisted. Own retries.
