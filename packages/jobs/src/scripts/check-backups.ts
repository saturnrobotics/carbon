/**
 * Checks that the backups customers already hold would still restore against the
 * current schema.
 *
 * A migration can make an existing backup unrestorable without the backup changing
 * at all — add a NOT NULL column with no DEFAULT and every backup taken before today
 * stops loading. Nobody finds out until someone clicks Restore, which is the worst
 * possible moment. So the question gets asked here, at commit time.
 *
 * The baseline is `packages/jobs/manifests/schema.json` AS IT STANDS ON `main` —
 * the schema real customer backups were taken against. The copy in the working tree
 * is not the baseline: it is regenerated from the live database on every successful
 * `--stage` run, so comparing against it would compare today with today.
 *
 * Runs from the pre-commit hook when `packages/database/supabase/migrations/**` is
 * touched; set CARBON_SKIP_BACKUP_CHECK=1 to skip it there.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm db:check:backups             # check only — writes nothing
 *   pnpm db:check:backups -- --stage  # ...then update and stage schema.json
