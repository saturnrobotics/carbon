// @carbon/planning — the planning engines (MRP + finite scheduling),
// relocated from the Supabase edge runtime to run in-process in Node. Every
// entry point takes an injected Kysely handle (and, for MRP, a service-role
// Supabase client); callers authenticate first. Server-only — pulls in
// pg/Kysely and @logtape, so import from route actions, *.service.ts,
// *.server.ts, or @carbon/jobs handlers, never client code.
