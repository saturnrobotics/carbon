# @carbon/utils

Pure utility functions shared across all Carbon packages and apps. Covers accounting, arrays, BOM, dates, numeric precision and formatting, math, strings, status helpers, storage rules, URL manipulation, and more.

## Always

- Import utilities from `@carbon/utils` — never duplicate utility logic in app code.
- Use `sanitize(obj)` to strip empty values before Supabase insert/update operations.
- Use domain-specific helpers where they exist: `formatCurrency()` for money, `getStatus()` for status resolution, `getBomLevel()` for BOM traversal.
- Keep utilities **pure** — no side effects, no database calls, no env access (except `isBrowser` check). Only `@internationalized/date`, `zod`, and `lodash.template` are allowed runtime deps.

## Ask First

- Adding new dependencies — this package is imported everywhere; new deps increase bundle size across all apps.
- Modifying `storage-rules.ts` — the `Operator` union is shared with `@carbon/workflows`, and the evaluator gates real inventory transactions.
- Changing `Edition` enum or `isBrowser` detection — used by `@carbon/env` and auth logic.

## Never

- Import server-only packages (`@carbon/auth`, `@carbon/database`, `@carbon/kv`) from here — `@carbon/utils` must remain client-safe. **Deliberate edge-shared utilities:** `precision.ts`, `accounting-currency.ts`, `accounting-posting.ts`, `payment-funding.ts`, `sales-posting-amounts.ts`, `batch-time-split.ts`, and `batch-compatibility.ts` each re-export their namesake under `packages/database/supabase/functions/shared/` by relative path (`math.ts` consumes `precision.ts`). Those implementations live there because the Supabase edge runtime only mounts `supabase/functions/`; re-exporting rather than duplicating keeps ONE source of truth so the Node and Deno sides never drift. They are client-safe source imports, not imports of the server/database package, and not something to "fix" (same pattern as `packages/database/src/sampling.ts`). Keep their dependency graphs pure.
- Add async/IO operations — utilities should be synchronous pure functions (the one exception is `supabase.ts` helpers which are typed wrappers).
- Duplicate what already exists — check the barrel export (`src/index.ts`) before adding a new utility.

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @carbon/utils test        # Runs storage-rules tests etc.
pnpm --filter @carbon/utils typecheck
```

## Key Modules

| Module | Provides |
|--------|----------|
| `accounting` | Currency formatting, financial calculations |
| `accounting-currency` | Explicit foreign-per-base conversion and settlement FX |
| `accounting-posting` | Original journal role vocabulary: `classifyAccountingPostingRole` maps a journal line's description by EXACT match — `Accounts Receivable`/`IC Receivables` → Receivables, `Accounts Payable`/`IC Payables` → Payables, `Shipping Revenue`, `Sales Account` — and returns `null` for anything else, which is how a `VOID: …` reversal line falls out (there is no explicit void branch) |
| `payment-funding` | Shared effective-settlement, invoice/funding balance reducers and exact document-principal allocation; callers own tenant/status/reservation queries |
| `sales-posting-amounts` | Pure sales component normalization and posting calculations |
| `arrays` | Array manipulation, grouping, deduplication |
| `bom` | Bill of Materials traversal and level computation |
| `date` | Date formatting, parsing, range helpers (uses `@internationalized/date`); `HOUR_MS`/`DAY_MS` millisecond constants for instant arithmetic |
| `datetime` | Server-side date derivation with mandatory explicit timezone: `timestamp()`, `today(tz)`, `now(tz)`, `businessDay(instant, tz)`, `weekBounds(tz, offset?, anchor?)` (DST-safe Monday→Sunday instant bounds), `weekNumber(date)`. DST/exotic-zone stress suite in `datetime.test.ts` (gap/overlap disambiguation, midnight-skipping zones, 167/169h weeks, ±30/45-min offsets). Mirrored for Deno at `packages/database/supabase/functions/lib/datetime.ts` — keep in sync |
| `hash` | The repo's stable content hashes — `fnv1a32`/`fnv1a64` (cache and idempotency keys) and `getBucket`. Browser-safe; never add `node:crypto` here |
| `math` | `clamp`/`lerp`/`inverseLerp` only — it re-exports nothing |
| `precision` | The whole numeric-precision API, re-exported from the edge-runtime module: `SCALE`, `EPSILON`, `RoundingMode`, `round`, `distributeRoundingResidual`, `scrapAllowance`, `applyRate`, `deriveRate`, `isBalanced`, `assertBalanced` |
| `format` | The ONLY place display/input digit counts are chosen: `moneyFormatOptions` (settlement — the currency's decimals are floor AND ceiling), `rateFormatOptions` (per-unit RATE — those decimals are only the floor, ceiling is `SCALE`), the `PERCENT_FORMAT` / `PERCENT_POINTS_FORMAT` / `SCALE_FORMAT` constants, `cldrCurrencyDecimals`, their `format*` helpers, and `INPUT_FORMAT` / `INPUT_STEP` for editable fields. Call sites pick a KIND, never a digit count |
| `string` | Slugify, truncate, camelCase/titleCase conversions |
| `revalidate` | `isSearchParamOnlyNavigation` — shared by both apps' shell `shouldRevalidate` |
| `status` | Status resolution, status color mapping |
| `storage-rules` | Inventory/storage rule engine: condition AST, the shared `Operator` vocabulary, JIT-compiled evaluator |
| `supabase` | Typed Supabase query helpers |
| `types` | Shared TypeScript types (`Edition`, generic utility types) |
| `field-registry` | Fields a storage rule may test, and which operators each one allows |
| `labels` | Human-readable label generation |
| `url` | URL construction and manipulation |

## Numeric precision

Every price, rate, quantity and amount follows the standard in
`.claude/rules/numeric-precision.md`: internal values at `SCALE = 5`, settlement
values at the currency's `decimalPlaces` (the DB column, authoritative over
Intl/CLDR), rounding only at persist / display / compare. Three checks in
`@carbon/checks` enforce it (`no-raw-rounding`, `no-inline-fraction-digits`,
`no-derived-percent-column`) and they scan this package.

## Cross-References

- `packages/env/` — imports `Edition` and `isBrowser` from this package
- `packages/database/` — service functions use `sanitize()` from here
- `apps/erp/`, `apps/mes/` — primary consumers of all utility functions
